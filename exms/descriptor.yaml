      abstract: "A previous paper considered the problems that presently limit the\
        \ hydrogen exchange - mass spectrometry (HX-MS) method for studying the biophysical\
        \ and functional properties of proteins. Many of these problems can be overcome\
        \ by obtaining and analyzing hundreds of sequentially overlapping peptide\
        \ fragments that cover the protein many times over (Mayne et al. J. Am. Soc.\
        \ Mass Spectrom. 2011: 10.1007/s13361-011-0235-4 ). This paper describes a\
        \ computer program called ExMS that furthers this advance by making it possible\
        \ to efficiently process crowded mass spectra and definitively identify and\
        \ characterize these many peptide fragments. ExMS automatically scans through\
        \ high resolution MS data to find the individual isotopic peaks and isotopic\
        \ envelopes of a list of peptides previously identified by MS/MS. It performs\
        \ a number of tests to ensure correct identification in spite of peptide overlap\
        \ in both chromatographic and mass spectrometric dimensions and possible multi-modal\
        \ envelopes due to static or dynamic structural heterogeneity or HX EX1 behavior.\
        \ The program can automatically process data from many sequential HX time\
        \ points with no operator intervention at the rate of \u223C2 sec per peptide\
        \ per HX time point using desktop computer equipment, but it also provides\
        \ for rapid manual checking and decision when ambiguity exists. Additional\
        \ subroutines can provide a step by step report of performance at each test\
        \ along the way and parameter adjustment, deconvolute isotopic envelopes,\
        \ and plot the time course of single and multi-modal H-D exchange. The program\
        \ will be available on an open source basis at: http://HX2.med.upenn.edu/download.html\
