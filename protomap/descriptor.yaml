description: Recently developed technique to map in vivo substrates of proteolytic
  events. It uses 1D SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to globally identify shifts in
  gel-migration and corresponding changes in the topography of proteolytic fragments.

      abstract: "Proteolysis is a key regulatory process that promotes the (in)activation,\
        \ translocation, and/or degradation of proteins. As such, there is considerable\
        \ interest in methods to comprehensively characterize proteolytic pathways\
        \ in biological systems. Here, we describe a robust and versatile proteomic\
        \ platform that enables direct visualization of the topography and magnitude\
        \ of proteolytic events on a global scale. We use this method to generate\
        \ a proteome-wide map of proteolytic events induced by the intrinsic apoptotic\
        \ pathway. This profile contained 91 characterized caspase substrates as well\
        \ as 170 additional proteins not previously known to be cleaved during apoptosis.\
        \ Surprisingly, the vast majority of proteolyzed proteins, regardless of the\
        \ extent of cleavage, yielded persistent fragments that correspond to discrete\
        \ protein domains, suggesting that the generation of active effector proteins\
        \ may be a principal function of apoptotic proteolytic cascades. \xA9 2008\
