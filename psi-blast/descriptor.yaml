      abstract: The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and
        DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons, a variety
        of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits
        the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while
        enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering
        the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped
        alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three
        times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically
        combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific
        score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting
        Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately
        the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more
        sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST
        is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.

      abstract: The recognition of remote protein homologies is a major aspect of
        the structural and functional annotation of newly determined genomes. Here
        we benchmark the coverage and error rate of genome annotation using the widely
        used homology-searching program PSI-BLAST (position-specific iterated basic
        local alignment search tool). This study evaluates the one-to-many success
        rate for recognition, as often there are several homologues in the database
        and only one needs to be identified for annotating the sequence. In contrast,
        previous benchmarks considered one-to-one recognition in which a single query
        was required to find a particular target. The benchmark constructs a model
        genome from the full sequences of the structural classification of protein
        (SCOP) database and searches against a target library of remote homologous
        domains (< 20% identity). The structural benchmark provides a reliable list
        of correct and false homology assignments. PSI-BLAST successfully annotated
        40% of the domains in the model genome that had at least one homologue in
        the target library. This coverage is more than three times that if one-to-one
        recognition is evaluated (11% coverage of domains). Although a structural
        benchmark was used, the results equally apply to just sequence homology searches.
        Accordingly, structural and sequence assignments were made to the sequences
        of Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (see http://www.bmm.icnet.uk).
        The extent of missed assignments and of new superfamilies can be estimated
        for these genomes for both structural and functional annotations.
