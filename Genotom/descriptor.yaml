  \ from different tomato cultivars. This platform includes genomes from Heinz 1706,\
  \ Lucariello and Corbarino (tomato landaraces) with related genome browsers and\
  \ transcriptomic data. It gives free access to the recently sequenced Italian tomato\
  \ varieties and offers tools for their comparative analysis. (Tranchida-Lombardo\
