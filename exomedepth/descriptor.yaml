      abstract: "Motivation: Exome sequencing has proven to be an effective tool to\
        \ discover the genetic basis of Mendelian disorders. It is well established\
        \ that copy number variants (CNVs) contribute to the etiology of these disorders.\
        \ However, calling CNVs from exome sequence data is challenging. A typical\
        \ read depth strategy consists of using another sample (or a combination of\
        \ samples) as a reference to control for the variability at the capture and\
        \ sequencing steps. However, technical variability between samples complicates\
        \ the analysis and can create spurious CNV calls.Results: Here, we introduce\
        \ ExomeDepth, a new CNV calling algorithm designed to control for this technical\
        \ variability. ExomeDepth uses a robust model for the read count data and\
        \ uses this model to build an optimized reference set in order to maximize\
        \ the power to detect CNVs. As a result, ExomeDepth is effective across a\
        \ wider range of exome datasets than the previously existing tools, even for\
        \ small (e.g. one to two exons) and heterozygous deletions. We used this new\
        \ approach to analyse exome data from 24 patients with primary immunodeficiencies.\
        \ Depending on data quality and the exact target region, we find between 170\
        \ and 250 exonic CNV calls per sample. Our analysis identified two novel causative\
        \ deletions in the genes GATA2 and DOCK8. \xA9 2012 The Author."
