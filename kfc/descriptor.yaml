description: Web-based implementation of the Knowledge-based FADE and Contacts model.
  It predicts the subset of residues responsible for the majority of a protein interface&apos,s
  binding free energy. Users input protein-protein or protein-DNA information for
  visualization of binding hot spots within the protein structure.

    metadata:
      abstract: The KFC Server is a web-based implementation of the KFC (Knowledge-based
        FADE and Contacts) model-a machine learning approach for the prediction of
        binding hot spots, or the subset of residues that account for most of a protein
        interface's; binding free energy. The server facilitates the automated analysis
        of a user submitted protein-protein or protein-DNA interface and the visualization
        of its hot spot predictions. For each residue in the interface, the KFC Server
        characterizes its local structural environment, compares that environment
        to the environments of experimentally determined hot spots and predicts if
        the interface residue is a hot spot. After the computational analysis, the
        user can visualize the results using an interactive job viewer able to quickly
        highlight predicted hot spots and surrounding structural features within the
        protein structure. The KFC Server is accessible at http://kfc.mitchell-lab.org.
