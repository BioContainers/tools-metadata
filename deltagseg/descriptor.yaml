      abstract: "Summary: Binding free energy calculations obtained through molecular\
        \ dynamics simulations reflect intermolecular interaction states through a\
        \ series of independent snapshots. Typically, the free energies of multiple\
        \ simulated series (each with slightly different starting conditions) need\
        \ to be estimated. Previous approaches carry out this task by moving averages\
        \ at certain decorrelation times, assuming that the system comes from a single\
        \ conformation description of binding events. Here, we discuss a more general\
        \ approach that uses statistical modeling, wavelets denoising and hierarchical\
        \ clustering to estimate the significance of multiple statistically distinct\
        \ subpopulations, reflecting potential macrostates of the system. We present\
        \ the deltaGseg R package that performs macrostate estimation from multiple\
        \ replicated series and allows molecular biologists/chemists to gain physical\
        \ insight into the molecular details that are not easily accessible by experimental\
        \ techniques. \xA9 The Author 2013."
