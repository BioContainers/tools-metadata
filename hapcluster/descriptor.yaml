      abstract: "We propose an algorithm for analysing SNP-based population association\
        \ studies, which is a development of that introduced by Molitor et al. [2003:\
        \ Am J Hum Genet 73:1368-1384]. It uses clustering of haplotypes to overcome\
        \ the major limitations of many current haplotype-based approaches. We define\
        \ a between-haplotype score that is simple, yet appears to capture much of\
        \ the information about evolutionary relatedness of the haplotypes in the\
        \ vicinity of a (unobserved) putative causal locus. Haplotype clusters can\
        \ then be defined via a putative ancestral haplotype and a cut-off distance.\
        \ The number of an individual's two haplotypes that lie within the cluster\
        \ predicts the individual's genotype at the causal locus. This predicted genotype\
        \ can then be investigated for association with the phenotype of interest.\
        \ We implement our approach within a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm that,\
        \ in effect, searches over locations and ancestral haplotypes to identify\
        \ large, case-rich clusters. The algorithm successfully fine-maps a causal\
        \ mutation in a test analysis using real data, and achieves almost 98% accuracy\
        \ in predicting the genotype at the causal locus. A simulation study indicates\
        \ that the new algorithm is substantially superior to alternative approaches,\
        \ and it also allows us to identify situations in which multipoint approaches\
        \ can substantially improve over single-SNP analyses. Our algorithm runs quickly\
        \ and there is scope for extension to a wide range of disease models and genomic\
        \ scales. \xA9 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
