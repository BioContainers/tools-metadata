      abstract: "Summary: The variant call format (VCF) is a generic format for storing\
        \ DNA polymorphism data such as SNPs, insertions, deletions and structural\
        \ variants, together with rich annotations. VCF is usually stored in a compressed\
        \ manner and can be indexed for fast data retrieval of variants from a range\
        \ of positions on the reference genome. The format was developed for the 1000\
        \ Genomes Project, and has also been adopted by other projects such as UK10K,\
        \ dbSNP and the NHLBI Exome Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements\
        \ various utilities for processing VCF files, including validation, merging,\
        \ comparing and also provides a general Perl API. \xA9 The Author(s) 2011.\

      abstract: "\xA9 The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on\
        \ behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. High-throughput data production technologies,\
        \ particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread\
        \ and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large\
        \ datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical\
        \ and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This\
        \ has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics\
        \ training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005,\
        \ the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework\
        \ that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks\
        \ to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible\
        \ by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational\
        \ analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection,\
        \ publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features\
        \ enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale."
