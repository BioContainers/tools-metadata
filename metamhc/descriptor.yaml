      abstract: "As antigenic peptides binding to major histocompatibility complex\
        \ (MHC) molecules is the prerequisite of cellular immune responses, an accurate\
        \ computational predictor will be of great benefit to biologists and immunologists\
        \ for understanding the underlying mechanism of immune recognition as well\
        \ as facilitating the process of epitope mapping and vaccine design. Although\
        \ various computational approaches have been developed, recent experimental\
        \ results on benchmark data sets show that the development of improved predictors\
        \ is needed, especially for MHC Class II peptide binding. To make the most\
        \ of current methods and achieve a higher predictive performance, we developed\
        \ a new web server, MetaMHC, to integrate the outputs of leading predictors\
        \ by several popular ensemble strategies. MetaMHC consists of two components:\
        \ MetaMHCI and MetaMHCII for MHC Class I peptide and MHC Class II peptide\
        \ binding predictions, respectively. Experimental results by both cross-validation\
        \ and using an independent data set show that the ensemble approaches outperform\
        \ individual predictors, being statistically significant. MetaMHC is freely\
        \ available at http://www.biokdd.fudan.edu .cn/Service/MetaMHC.html. \xA9\
