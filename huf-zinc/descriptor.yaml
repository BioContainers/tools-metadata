      abstract: "Data mining in protein databases, derivatives from more fundamental\
        \ protein 3D structure and sequence databases, has considerable unearthed\
        \ potential for the discovery of sequence motif-structural motif-function\
        \ relationships as the finding of the U-shape (Huf-Zinc) motif, originally\
        \ a small student's project, exemplifies. The metal ion zinc is critically\
        \ involved in universal biological processes, ranging from protein-DNA complexes\
        \ and transcription regulation to enzymatic catalysis and metabolic pathways.\
        \ Proteins have evolved a series of motifs to specifically recognize and bind\
        \ zinc ions. Many of these, so called zinc fingers, are structurally independent\
        \ globular domains with discontinuous binding motifs made up of residues mostly\
        \ far apart in sequence. Through a systematic approach starting from the BRIX\
        \ structure fragment database, we discovered that there exists another predictable\
        \ subset of zinc-binding motifs that not only have a conserved continuous\
        \ sequence pattern but also share a characteristic local conformation, despite\
        \ being included in totally different overall folds. While this does not allow\
        \ general prediction of all Zn binding motifs, a HMM-based web server, Huf-Zinc,\
        \ is available for prediction of these novel, as well as conventional, zinc\
        \ finger motifs in protein sequences. The Huf-Zinc webserver can be freely\
        \ accessed through this URL (). \xA9 2013 Imperial College Press."
