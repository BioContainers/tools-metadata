        \ under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits\

        \ the original author and source are credited.Background Protein superfamilies\
        \ can be divided into subfamilies of proteins with different functional characteristics.\
        \ Their sequences can be classified hierarchically, which is part of sequence\
        \ function assignation. Typically, there are no clear subfamily hallmarks\
        \ that would allow pattern-based function assignation by which this task is\
        \ mostly achieved based on the similarity principle. This is hampered by the\
        \ lack of a score cut-off that is both sensitive and specific. Results HMMER\
        \ Cut-off Threshold Tool (HMMERCTTER) adds a reliable cut-off threshold to\
        \ the popular HMMER. Using a high quality superfamily phylogeny, it clusters\
        \ a set of training sequences such that the cluster-specific HMMER profiles\
        \ show cluster or subfamily member detection with 100% precision and recall\
        \ (P&R), thereby generating a specific threshold as inclusion cut-off. Profiles\
        \ and thresholds are then used as classifiers to screen a target dataset.\
        \ Iterative inclusion of novel sequences to groups and the corresponding HMMER\
        \ profiles results in high sensitivity while specificity is maintained by\
        \ imposing 100% P&R self detection. In three presented case studies of protein\
        \ superfamilies, classification of large datasets with 100% precision was\
        \ achieved with over 95% recall. Limits and caveats are presented and explained.\
        \ Conclusions HMMERCTTER is a promising protein superfamily sequence classifier\
        \ provided high quality training datasets are used. It provides a decision\
        \ support system that aids in the difficult task of sequence function assignation\
        \ in the twilight zone of sequence similarity. All relevant data and source\
        \ codes are available from the Github repository at the following URL: https://\
        \ github.com/BBCMdP/HMMERCTTER."
