      abstract: "High-throughput metabolomic experiments aim at identifying and ultimately\
        \ quantifying all metabolites present in biological systems. The metabolites\
        \ are interconnected through metabolic reactions, generally grouped into metabolic\
        \ pathways. Classical metabolic maps provide a relational context to help\
        \ interpret metabolomics experiments and a wide range of tools have been developed\
        \ to help place metabolites within metabolic pathways. However, the representation\
        \ of metabolites within separate disconnected pathways overlooks most of the\
        \ connectivity of the metabolome. By definition, reference pathways cannot\
        \ integrate novel pathways nor show relationships between metabolites that\
        \ may be linked by common neighbours without being considered as joint members\
        \ of a classical biochemical pathway. MetExplore is a web server that offers\
        \ the possibility to link metabolites identified in untargeted metabolomics\
        \ experiments within the context of genome-scale reconstructed metabolic networks.\
        \ The analysis pipeline comprises mapping metabolomics data onto the specific\
        \ metabolic network of an organism, then applying graph-based methods and\
        \ advanced visualization tools to enhance data analysis. The MetExplore web\
        \ server is freely accessible at http://metexplore.toulouse.inra.fr. \xA9\
