description: Tool for searching the Pfam database using a parallelized version of
  the program hmmpfam. The user can perform queries with one or more sequences at
  a time and then receive the results by e-mail.

    metadata:
      abstract: "The SledgeHMMER web server is intended for genome-scale searching\
        \ of the Pfam database without having to install this database and the HMMER\
        \ software locally. The server implements a parallelized version of hmmpfam,\
        \ the program used for searching the Pfam HMM database. Pfam search results\
        \ have been calculated for the entire Swiss-Prot and TrEmbl database sequences\
        \ (\u223C1.2 million) on 256 processors of IA64-based teragrid machines. The\
        \ Pfam database can be searched in local, glocal or merged mode, using either\
        \ gathering or E-value thresholds. Query sequences are first matched against\
        \ the pre-calculated entries to retrieve results, and those without matches\
        \ are processed through a new search process. Results are emailed in a space-delimited\
        \ tabular format upon completion of the search. While most other Pfam-searching\
        \ web servers set a limit of one sequence per query, this server processes\
        \ batch sequences with no limit on the number of input sequences. The web\
        \ server and downloadable data are accessible from http://SledgeHmmer.sdsc.edu.\
