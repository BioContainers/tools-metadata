      abstract: "Normal mode analysis (NMA) is a powerful tool for predicting the\
        \ possible movements of a given macromolecule. It has been shown recently\
        \ that half of the known protein movements can be modelled by using at most\
        \ two low-frequency normal modes. Applications of NMA cover wide areas of\
        \ structural biology, such as the study of protein conformational changes\
        \ upon ligand binding, membrane channel opening and closure, potential movements\
        \ of the ribosome, and viral capsid maturation. Another, newly emerging field\
        \ of NMA is related to protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography,\
        \ where normal mode perturbed models are used as templates for diffraction\
        \ data phasing through molecular replacement(MR). Here we present EIN\xE9\
        mo,a web interface to the Elastic Network Model that provides a fast and simple\
        \ tool to compute, visualize and analyse low-frequency normal modes of large\
        \ macro-molecules and to generate a large number of different starting models\
        \ for use in MR. Due to the 'rotation-translation-block' (RTB) approximation\
        \ implemented in EIN\xE9mo, there is virtually no upper limit to the size\
        \ of the proteins that can be treated. Upon input of a protein structure in\
        \ Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, EIN\xE9mo computes its 100 lowest-frequency\
        \ modes and produces a comprehensive set of descriptive parameters and visualizations,\
        \ such as the degree of collectivity of movement, residue mean square displacements,\
        \ distance fluctuation maps, and the correlation between observed and normal-mode-derived\
        \ atomic displacement parameters (B-factors). Any number of normal mode perturbed\
        \ models for MR can be generated for download. If two conformations of the\
        \ same (or a homologous) protein are available, EIN\xE9mo identifies the normal\
        \ modes that contribute most to the corresponding protein movement. The web\
        \ server can be freely accessed at http://igs-server.cnrs-mrs.fr/elnemo/index.html.\
