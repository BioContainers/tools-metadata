      abstract: "\xA9 Bostan and Chiusano; licensee BioMed Central.Next Generation\
        \ Sequencing technologies (NGS) unexpectedly pushed forward the capability\
        \ of solving genome organization and of widely depicting gene expression.\
        \ However, although the flourishing of tools to process the NGS data, versatile\
        \ and user-friendly computational environments for integrative and comparative\
        \ analyses of the results from the increasing amount of collections are still\
        \ required. Description: Here we present the architecture and the facilities\
        \ of , a web based platform that offers processed NGS transcriptome collections\
        \ and enables immediate analyses of the results. The platform allows gene\
        \ expression investigations, profiling and comparisons, and exploits different\
        \ resources. Conclusion: In the current version, includes processed and normalized\
        \ NGS expression data from three collections covering several tissue/stages\
        \ from different genotypes. Beyond providing a user-friendly interface, the\
        \ platform was designed with the aim to easily be expanded to include other\
        \ NGS based transcriptome collections. It can also integrate different genome\
        \ releases, possibly from different cultivars or genotypes, but even from\
        \ different species. The platform is proposed as an example effort in tomato,\
        \ and is described as a profitable approach for the exploitation of these\
        \ challenging and precious datasets."
