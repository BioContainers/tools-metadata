      abstract: "Despite the known existence of distant-acting cis-regulatory elements\
        \ in the human genome, only a small fraction of these elements has been identified\
        \ and experimentally characterized in vivo. This paucity of enhancer collections\
        \ with defined activities has thus hindered computational approaches for the\
        \ genome-wide prediction of enhancers and their functions. To fill this void,\
        \ we utilize comparative genome analysis to identify candidate enhancer elements\
        \ in the human genome coupled with the experimental determination of their\
        \ in vivo enhancer activity in transgenic mice [L. A. Pennacchio et al. (2006)\
        \ Nature, in press]. These data are available through the VISTA Enhancer Browser\
        \ (http://enhancer.lbl.gov). This growing database currently contains over\
        \ 250 experimentally tested DNA fragments, of which more than 100 have been\
        \ validated as tissue-specific enhancers. For each positive enhancer, we provide\
        \ digital images of whole-mount embryo staining at embryonic day 11.5 and\
        \ an anatomical description of the reporter gene expression pattern. Users\
        \ can retrieve elements near single genes of interest, search for enhancers\
        \ that target reporter gene expression to a particular tissue, or download\
        \ entire collections of enhancers with a defined tissue specificity or conservation\
        \ depth. These experimentally validated training sets are expected to provide\
        \ a basis for a wide range of downstream computational and functional studies\
        \ of enhancer function. \xA9 2007 Oxford University Press."
