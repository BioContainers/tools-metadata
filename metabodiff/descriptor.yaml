      abstract: 'Summary: Comparative metabolomics comes of age through commercial
        vendors offering metabolomics for translational researchers outside the mass
        spectrometry field. The MetaboDiff packages aims to provide a low-level entry
        to differential metabolomic analysis with R by starting off with the table
        of metabolite measurements. As a key functionality, MetaboDiffs offers the
        exploration of sample traits in a data-derived metabolic correlation network.
        Availability and implementation: The MetaboDiff R package is platform-independent,
        available at http://github.com/andreasmock/MetaboDiff/ and released under
        the MIT licence. The package documentation comprises a step-by-step markdown
        tutorial. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics
        online.'
