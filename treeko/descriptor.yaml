      abstract: "Comparisons of tree topologies provide relevant information in evolutionary\
        \ studies. Most existing methods share the drawback of requiring a complete\
        \ and exact mapping of terminal nodes between the compared trees. This severely\
        \ limits the scope of genome-wide analyses, since trees containing duplications\
        \ are pruned arbitrarily or discarded. To overcome this, we have developed\
        \ treeKO, an algorithm that enables the comparison of tree topologies, even\
        \ in the presence of duplication and loss events. To do so treeKO recursively\
        \ splits gene trees into pruned trees containing only orthologs to subsequently\
        \ compute a distance based on the combined analyses of all pruned tree comparisons.\
        \ In addition treeKO, implements the possibility of computing phylome support\
        \ values, and reconciliation-based measures such as the number of inferred\
        \ duplication and loss events. \xA9 2011 The Author(s)."
