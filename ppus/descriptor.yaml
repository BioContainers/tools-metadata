      abstract: "\xA9 2015 The Author.Motivation: Pseudouridine (\u03A8), catalyzed\
        \ by pseudouridine synthase (PUS), is the most abundant RNA modification and\
        \ has important cellular functions. Developing an algorithm to identify \u03A8\
        \ sites is an important work. And it is better if the algorithm could assign\
        \ which PUS modifies the \u03A8 sites. Here, we developed PPUS (http://lyh.pkmu.cn/ppus/),\
        \ the first web server to predict PUS-specific \u03A8 sites. PPUS employed\
        \ support vector machine as the classifier and used nucleotides around \u03A8\
        \ sites as the features. Currently, PPUS could accurately predict new \u03A8\
        \ sites for PUS1, PUS4 and PUS7 in yeast and PUS4 in human. PPUS is well designed\
        \ and friendly to user."
