      abstract: We describe FrameD, a program that predicts coding regions in prokaryotic
        and matured eukaryotic sequences. Initially targeted at gene prediction in
        bacterial GC rich genomes, the gene model used in FrameD also allows to predict
        genes in the presence of frameshifts and partially undetermined sequences
        which makes it also very suitable for gene prediction and frameshift correction
        in unfinished sequences such as EST and EST cluster sequences. Like recent
        eukaryotic gene prediction programs, FrameD also includes the ability to take
        into account protein similarity information both in its prediction and its
        graphical output. Its performances are evaluated on different bacterial genomes.
        The web site (http://genopole.toulouse.inra.fr/bioinfo/FrameD/FD) allows direct
        prediction, sequence correction and translation and the ability to learn new
        models for new organisms.
