description: dbNSFP is a database developed for functional prediction and annotation
  of all potential non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) and splice-site
  variants (ssSNVs) in the human genome. It also facilitates the steps of filtering
  and prioritizing SNVs from a large list of SNVs discovered in an exome-sequencing
  study.

      abstract: "\xA9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.The purpose of the dbNSFP is to\
        \ provide a one-stop resource for functional predictions and annotations for\
        \ human nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) and splice-site\
        \ variants (ssSNVs), and to facilitate the steps of filtering and prioritizing\
        \ SNVs from a large list of SNVs discovered in an exome-sequencing study.\
        \ A list of all potential nsSNVs and ssSNVs based on the human reference sequence\
        \ were created and functional predictions and annotations were curated and\
        \ compiled for each SNV. Here, we report a recent major update of the database\
        \ to version 3.0. The SNV list has been rebuilt based on GENCODE 22 and currently\
        \ the database includes 82,832,027 nsSNVs and ssSNVs. An attached database\
        \ dbscSNV, which compiled all potential human SNVs within splicing consensus\
        \ regions and their deleteriousness predictions, add another 15,030,459 potentially\
        \ functional SNVs. Eleven prediction scores (MetaSVM, MetaLR, CADD, VEST3,\
        \ PROVEAN, 4\xD7 fitCons, fathmm-MKL, and DANN) and allele frequencies from\
        \ the UK10K cohorts and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), among others,\
        \ have been added. The original seven prediction scores in v2.0 (SIFT, 2\xD7\
        \ Polyphen2, LRT, MutationTaster, MutationAssessor, and FATHMM) as well as\
        \ many SNV and gene functional annotations have been updated. dbNSFP v3.0\
        \ is freely available at http://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/dbNSFP. The\
        \ purpose of the dbNSFP is to provide a one-stop resource for functional predictions\
        \ and annotations for human non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (nsSNVs)\
        \ and splice site variants (ssSNVs), and to facilitate the steps of filtering\
        \ and prioritizing SNVs from a large list of SNVs discovered in an exome-sequencing\
        \ study. Here we report a recent major update of the database to version 3.0\
        \ and some preliminary analyses comparing the 24 functional prediction scores\
        \ and conservation scores in dbNSFP v3.0."
