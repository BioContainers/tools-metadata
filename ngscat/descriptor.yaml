      abstract: "Motivation: Targeted enrichment sequencing by next-generation sequencing\
        \ is a common approach to interrogate specific loci or the whole exome in\
        \ the human genome. The efficiency and the lack of bias in the enrichment\
        \ process need to be assessed as a quality control step before performing\
        \ downstream analysis of the sequence data. Tools that can report on the sensitivity,\
        \ specificity, uniformity and other enrichment-specific features are needed.\
        \ Results: We have implemented the next-generation sequencing data Capture\
        \ Assessment Tool (ngsCAT), a tool that takes the information of the mapped\
        \ reads and the coordinates of the targeted regions as input files, and generates\
        \ a report with metrics and figures that allows the evaluation of the efficiency\
        \ of the enrichment process. The tool can also take as input the information\
        \ of two samples allowing the comparison of two different experiments. \xA9\
