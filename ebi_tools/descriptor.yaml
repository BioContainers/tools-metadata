description: EBI Tools is a project that aims to provide programmatic access to the
  various databases and retrieval and analysis services that the European Bioinformatics
  Institute (EBI) provides through Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and other
  related web service technologies. Example tools include those to compute sequence
  similarity searches, pairwise/multiple sequence alignment and protein functional
  analysis.

      abstract: The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) has been providing
        access to mainstream databases and tools in bioinformatics since 1997. In
        addition to the traditional web form based interfaces, APIs exist for core
        data resources such as EMBL-Bank, Ensembl, UniProt, InterPro, PDB and ArrayExpress.
        These APIs are based on Web Services (SOAP/REST) interfaces that allow users
        to systematically access databases and analytical tools. From the user's point
        of view, these Web Services provide the same functionality as the browser-based
        forms. However, using the APIs frees the user from web page constraints and
        are ideal for the analysis of large batches of data, performing text-mining
        tasks and the casual or systematic evaluation of mathematical models in regulatory
        networks. Furthermore, these services are widespread and easy to use; require
        no prior knowledge of the technology and no more than basic experience in
        programming. In the following we wish to inform of new and updated services
        as well as briefly describe planned developments to be made available during
        the course of 2009-2010.

      abstract: Since 2004 the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) has provided
        access to a wide range of databases and analysis tools via Web Services interfaces.
        This comprises services to search across the databases available from the
        EMBL-EBI and to explore the network of cross-references present in the data
        (e.g. EB-eye), services to retrieve entry data in various data formats and
        to access the data in specific fields (e.g. dbfetch), and analysis tool services,
        for example, sequence similarity search (e.g. FASTA and NCBI BLAST), multiple
        sequence alignment (e.g. Clustal Omega and MUSCLE), pairwise sequence alignment
        and protein functional analysis (e.g. InterProScan and Phobius). The REST/SOAP
        Web Services (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/) interfaces to these
        databases and tools allow their integration into other tools, applications,
        web sites, pipeline processes and analytical workflows. To get users started
        using the Web Services, sample clients are provided covering a range of programming
        languages and popular Web Service tool kits, and a brief guide to Web Services
        technologies, including a set of tutorials, is available for those wishing
        to learn more and develop their own clients. Users of the Web Services are
        informed of improvements and updates via a range of methods.
