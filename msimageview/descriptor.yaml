      abstract: "In biomedical research, the discovery of new biomarkers and new drugs\
        \ demands analytical techniques with high sensitivity together with increased\
        \ throughput. The possibility to localize or to follow changes in organisms\
        \ at the molecular level by imaging component distributions of specific tissues,\
        \ is of prime importance to unravel biochemical pathways and develop new treatments\
        \ and drugs. Established molecular imaging techniques such as MRI and PET\
        \ are already widely used, however their need for molecular probes to report\
        \ the presence of the analytes of interest precludes the simultaneous exploration\
        \ of different biomolecules. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass\
        \ spectrometric imaging (MALDI MSI) takes full advantage of the high sensitivity\
        \ of mass spectrometry instrumentation but also of the ability of the latter\
        \ to simultaneously detect a wide range of compounds, almost regardless from\
        \ their nature and mass. To perform MALDI MSI, sections of biological tissues\
        \ are introduced in an MALDI MS instrument, where the UV pulsed laser of the\
        \ MALDI source is used to raster over a selected area while acquiring mass\
        \ spectra of the ablated ions at every image point. From this array of spectra,\
        \ hundreds of analyte-specific images can be generated based on the selected\
        \ masses. MALDI MSI can be used to track biomarkers such as peptides or proteins\
        \ but also to map drug/tissue interactions. In this paper, an overview of\
        \ the possibilities of MSI will be given. As an example, MSI on brain tissue\
        \ sections for the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be shown. Mapping\
        \ of amyloid peptides as a new approach for drug lead optimization will be\
        \ presented. Target identification thanks to MSI will be introduced and the\
        \ last part will be dedicated to the molecular scanner approach, which gives\
        \ access to high-mass range by combining tissue blotting and digestion in\
        \ a one-step process. \xA9 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
