      abstract: "\xA9 2015 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.\
        \ All rights reserved. Motivation: Current informatic techniques for processing\
        \ raw chromatography/mass spectrometry data break down under several common,\
        \ non-ideal conditions. Importantly, hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography\
        \ (a key separation technology for metabolomics) produces data which are especially\
        \ challenging to process. We identify three critical points of failure in\
        \ current informatic workflows: compound specific drift, integration region\
        \ variance, and naive missing value imputation. We implement the Warpgroup\
        \ algorithm to address these challenges. Results: Warpgroup adds peak subregion\
        \ detection, consensus integration bound detection, and intelligent missing\
        \ value imputation steps to the conventional informatic workflow. When compared\
        \ with the conventional workflow, Warpgroup made major improvements to the\
        \ processed data. The coefficient of variation for peaks detected in replicate\
        \ injections of a complex Escherichia Coli extract were halved (a reduction\
        \ of 19%). Integration regions across samples were much more robust. Additionally,\
        \ many signals lost by the conventional workflow were 'rescued' by the Warpgroup\
        \ refinement, thereby resulting in greater analyte coverage in the processed\
        \ data. Availability and implementation: Warpgroup is an open source R package\
        \ available on GitHub at github.com/nathaniel-mahieu/warpgroup. The package\
        \ includes example data and XCMS compatibility wrappers for ease of use. Supplementary\
        \ information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\
