    abstract: CellNetAnalyzer (CNA) is a MATLAB toolbox providing computational methods
      for studying structure and function of metabolic and cellular signaling networks.
      In order to allow non-experts to use these methods easily, CNA provides GUI-based
      interactive network maps as a means of parameter input and result visualization.
      However, with the availability of high-throughput data, there is a need to make
      CNA's functionality also accessible in batch mode for automatic data processing.
      Furthermore, as some algorithms of CNA are of general relevance for network
      analysis it would be desirable if they could be called as sub-routines by other
      applications. For this purpose, we developed an API (application programming
      interface) for CNA allowing users (i) to access the content of network models
      in CNA, (ii) to use CNA's network analysis capabilities independent of the GUI,
      and (iii) to interact with the GUI to facilitate the development of graphical
      plugins.Here we describe the organization of network projects in CNA and the
      application of the new API functions to these projects. This includes the creation
      of network projects from scratch, loading and saving of projects and scenarios,
      and the application of the actual analysis methods. Furthermore, API functions
      for the import/export of metabolic models in SBML format and for accessing the
      GUI are described. Lastly, two example applications demonstrate the use and
      versatile applicability of CNA's API. CNA is freely available for academic use
      and can be downloaded from http://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html.
