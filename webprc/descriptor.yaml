    metadata:
      abstract: Profile-profile methods are well suited to detect remote evolutionary
        relationships between protein families. Profile Comparer (PRC) is an existing
        stand-alone program for scoring and aligning hidden Markov models (HMMs),
        which are based on multiple sequence alignments. Since PRC compares profile
        HMMs instead of sequences, it can be used to find distant homologues. For
        this purpose, PRC is used by, for example, the CATH and Pfam-domain databases.
        As PRC is a profile comparer, it only reports profile HMM alignments and does
        not produce multiple sequence alignments. We have developed webPRC server,
        which makes it straightforward to search for distant homologues or similar
        alignments in a number of domain databases. In addition, it provides the results
        both as multiple sequence alignments and aligned HMMs. Furthermore, the user
        can view the domain annotation, evaluate the PRC hits with the Jalview multiple
        alignment editor and generate logos from the aligned HMMs or the aligned multiple
        alignments. Thus, this server assists in detecting distant homologues with
        PRC as well as in evaluating and using the results. The webPRC interface is
        available at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/ programs/prcwww/.
