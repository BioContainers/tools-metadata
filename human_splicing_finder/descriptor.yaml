description: 'The Human Splicing Finder (HSF) system combines 12 different algorithms

  Silencers (ESS).'

    abstract: Thousands of mutations are identified yearly. Although many directly
      affect protein expression, an increasing proportion of mutations is now believed
      to influence mRNA splicing. They mostly affect existing splice sites, but synonymous,
      non-synonymous or nonsense mutations can also create or disrupt splice sites
      or auxiliary cis-splicing sequences. To facilitate the analysis of the different
      mutations, we designed Human Splicing Finder (HSF), a tool to predict the effects
      of mutations on splicing signals or to identify splicing motifs in any human
      sequence. It contains all available matrices for auxiliary sequence prediction
      as well as new ones for binding sites of the 9G8 and Tra2-β Serine-Arginine
      proteins and the hnRNP A1 ribonucleoprotein. We also developed new Position
      Weight Matrices to assess the strength of 5′ and 3′ splice sites and branch
      points. We evaluated HSF efficiency using a set of 83 intronic and 35 exonic
      mutations known to result in splicing defects. We showed that the mutation effect
      was correctly predicted in almost all cases. HSF could thus represent a valuable
      resource for research, diagnostic and therapeutic (e.g. therapeutic exon skipping)
      purposes as well as for global studies, such as the GEN2PHEN European Project
      or the Human Variome Project. © 2009 The Author(s).
