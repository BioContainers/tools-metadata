description: It is repository for clinicians and scientists working in the rare disorder
  community. It enables secure sharing of case records by clinicians and rare disease
  scientists and helps the user to find additional cases of the same unnamed disorder.
  The repository identifies similar patients in the database based on semantic similarity
  between clinical features, automatically prioritized genes from whole-exome data,
  and candidate genes entered by the users.

      abstract: "\xA9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.The discovery of disease-causing\
        \ mutations typically requires confirmation of the variant or gene in multiple\
        \ unrelated individuals, and a large number of rare genetic diseases remain\
        \ unsolved due to difficulty identifying second families. To enable the secure\
        \ sharing of case records by clinicians and rare disease scientists, we have\
        \ developed the PhenomeCentral portal (https://phenomecentral.org). Each record\
        \ includes a phenotypic description and relevant genetic information (exome\
        \ or candidate genes). PhenomeCentral identifies similar patients in the database\
        \ based on semantic similarity between clinical features, automatically prioritized\
        \ genes from whole-exome data, and candidate genes entered by the users, enabling\
        \ both hypothesis-free and hypothesis-driven matchmaking. Users can then contact\
        \ other submitters to follow up on promising matches. PhenomeCentral incorporates\
        \ data for over 1,000 patients with rare genetic diseases, contributed by\
        \ the FORGE and Care4Rare Canada projects, the US NIH Undiagnosed Diseases\
        \ Program, the EU Neuromics and ANDDIrare projects, as well as numerous independent\
        \ clinicians and scientists. Though the majority of these records have associated\
        \ exome data, most lack a molecular diagnosis. PhenomeCentral has already\
        \ been used to identify causative mutations for several patients, and its\
        \ ability to find matching patients and diagnose these diseases will grow\
        \ with each additional patient that is entered."
