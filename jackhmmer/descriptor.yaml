      abstract: "\xA9 2015 The Author(s). The HMMER website, available at http://www.ebi.ac.\
        \ uk/Tools/hmmer/, provides access to the protein homology search algorithms\
        \ found in the HMMER software suite. Since the first release of the website\
        \ in 2011, the search repertoire has been expanded to include the iterative\
        \ search algorithm, jackhmmer. The continued growth of the target sequence\
        \ databases means that traditional tabular representations of significant\
        \ sequence hits can be overwhelming to the user. Consequently, additional\
        \ ways of presenting homology search results have been developed, allowing\
        \ them to be summarised according to taxonomic distribution or domain architecture.\
        \ The taxonomy and domain architecture representations can be used in combination\
        \ to filter the results according to the needs of a user. Searches can also\
        \ be restricted prior to submission using a new taxonomic filter, which not\
        \ only ensures that the results are specific to the requested taxonomic group,\
        \ but also improves search performance. The repertoire of profile hidden Markov\
        \ model libraries, which are used for annotation of query sequences with protein\
        \ families and domains, has been expanded to include the libraries from CATH-Gene3D,\
        \ PIRSF, Superfamily and TIGRFAMs. Finally, we discuss the relocation of the\
        \ HMMER webserver to the European Bioinformatics Institute and the potential\
        \ impact that this will have."
