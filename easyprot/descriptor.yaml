      abstract: "High throughput protein identification and quantification analysis\
        \ based on mass spectrometry are fundamental steps in most proteomics projects.\
        \ Here, we present EasyProt (available at http://easyprot.unige.ch), a new\
        \ platform for mass spectrometry data processing, protein identification,\
        \ quantification and unexpected post-translational modification characterization.\
        \ EasyProt provides a fully integrated graphical experience to perform a large\
        \ part of the proteomic data analysis workflow. Our goal was to develop a\
        \ software platform that would fulfill the needs of scientists in the field,\
        \ while emphasizing ease-of-use for non-bioinformatician users. Protein identification\
        \ is based on OLAV scoring schemes and protein quantification is implemented\
        \ for both, isobaric labeling and label-free methods. Additional features\
        \ are available, such as peak list processing, isotopic correction, spectra\
        \ filtering, charge-state deconvolution and spectra merging. To illustrate\
        \ the EasyProt platform, we present two identification and quantification\
        \ workflows based on isobaric tagging and label-free methods. \xA9 2012 Elsevier\
