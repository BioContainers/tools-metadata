description: Provides the ability to find structural matches to a user-specified catalytic
  site among all Protein Data Bank (PDB) proteins. The web server can also examine
  a user-specified protein to identify structural matches to a library of catalytic
  sites.

      abstract: The catalytic site identification web server provides the innovative
        capability to find structural matches to a user-specified catalytic site among
        all Protein Data Bank proteins rapidly (in less than a minute). The server
        also can examine a user-specified protein structure or model to identify structural
        matches to a library of catalytic sites. Finally, the server provides a database
        of pre-calculated matches between all Protein Data Bank proteins and the library
        of catalytic sites. The database has been used to derive a set of hypothesized
        novel enzymatic function annotations. In all cases, matches and putative binding
        sites (protein structure and surfaces) can be visualized interactively online.
        The website can be accessed at http://catsid.llnl.gov.
