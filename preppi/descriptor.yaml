      abstract: "PrePPI (http://bhapp.c2b2.columbia.edu/PrePPI) is a database that\
        \ combines predicted and experimentally determined protein-protein interactions\
        \ (PPIs) using a Bayesian framework. Predicted interactions are assigned probabilities\
        \ of being correct, which are derived from calculated likelihood ratios (LRs)\
        \ by combining structural, functional, evolutionary and expression information,\
        \ with the most important contribution coming from structure. Experimentally\
        \ determined interactions are compiled from a set of public databases that\
        \ manually collect PPIs from the literature and are also assigned LRs. A final\
        \ probability is then assigned to every interaction by combining the LRs for\
        \ both predicted and experimentally determined interactions. The current version\
        \ of PrePPI contains \u223C2 million PPIs that have a probability more than\
        \ 0.1 of which \u223C60000 PPIs for yeast and \u223C370000 PPIs for human\
        \ are considered high confidence (probability > 0.5). The PrePPI database\
        \ constitutes an integrated resource that enables users to examine aggregate\
        \ information on PPIs, including both known and potentially novel interactions,\
        \ and that provides structural models for many of the PPIs. \xA9 The Author(s)\
