    abstract: Â© 2015 Kutmon et al. PathVisio is a commonly used pathway editor, visualization
      and analysis software. Biological pathways have been used by biologists for
      many years to describe the detailed steps in biological processes. Those powerful,
      visual representations help researchers to better understand, share and discuss
      knowledge. Since the first publication of PathVisio in 2008, the original paper
      was cited more than 170 times and PathVisio was used in many different biological
      studies. As an online editor PathVisio is also integrated in the community curated
      pathway database WikiPathways.Here we present the third version of PathVisio
      with the newest additions and improvements of the application. The core features
      of PathVisio are pathway drawing, advanced data visualization and pathway statistics.
      Additionally, PathVisio 3 introduces a new powerful extension systems that allows
      other developers to contribute additional functionality in form of plugins without
      changing the core application.PathVisio can be downloaded from http://www.pathvisio.org
      and in 2014 PathVisio 3 has been downloaded over 5,500 times. There are already
      more than 15 plugins available in the central plugin repository. PathVisio is
      a freely available, open-source tool published under the Apache 2.0 license
      (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). It is implemented in Java and
      thus runs on all major operating systems. The code repository is available at
      http://svn.bigcat.unimaas.nl/pathvisio. The support mailing list for users is
      available on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wikipathways-discuss and
      for developers on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wikipathways-devel.
