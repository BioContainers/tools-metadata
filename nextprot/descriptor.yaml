description: neXtProt is an innovative knowledge platform dedicated to human proteins.
  This resource contains a wealth of high-quality data on all the human proteins that
  are produced by the 20'000 protein-coding genes found in the human genome. The content
  of neXtProt is continuously extended so as to provide many more carefully selected
  data sets and analysis tools.

      abstract: "About 5000 (25%) of the \u223C20400 human protein-coding genes currently\
        \ lack any experimental evidence at the protein level. For many others, there\
        \ is only little information relative to their abundance, distribution, subcellular\
        \ localization, interactions, or cellular functions. The aim of the HUPO Human\
        \ Proteome Project (HPP, www.thehpp. org) is to collect this information for\
        \ every human protein. HPP is based on three major pillars: mass spectrometry\
        \ (MS), antibody/affinity capture reagents (Ab), and bioinformaticsdriven\
        \ knowledge base (KB). To meet this objective, the Chromosome-Centric Human\
        \ Proteome Project (C-HPP) proposes to build this catalog chromosome-by-chromosome\
        \ (www.c-hpp.org) by focusing primarily on proteins that currently lack MS\
        \ evidence or Ab detection. These are termed missing proteins by the HPP consortium.\
        \ The lack of observation of a protein can be due to various factors including\
        \ incorrect and incomplete gene annotation, low or restricted expression,\
        \ or instability. neXtProt (www.nextprot.org) is a new web-based knowledge\
        \ platform specific for human proteins that aims to complement UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot\
        \ (www.uniprot.org) with detailed information obtained from carefully selected\
        \ highthroughput experiments on genomic variation, post-translational modifications,\
        \ as well as protein expression in tissues and cells. This article describes\
        \ how neXtProt contributes to prioritize C-HPP efforts and integrates C-HPP\
        \ results with other research efforts to create a complete human proteome\
        \ catalog. \xA9 2012 American Chemical Society."
