      abstract: "\xA9 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Accurate estimation of terrestrial\
        \ gross primary productivity (GPP) remains a challenge despite its importance\
        \ in the global carbon cycle. Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) has been recently\
        \ adopted to understand photosynthesis and its response to the environment,\
        \ particularly with remote sensing data. However, it remains unclear how ChlF\
        \ and photosynthesis are linked at different spatial scales across the growing\
        \ season. We examined seasonal relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis\
        \ at the leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales and explored how leaf-level ChlF\
        \ was linked with canopy-scale solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)\
        \ in a temperate deciduous forest at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. Our\
        \ results show that ChlF captured the seasonal variations of photosynthesis\
        \ with significant linear relationships between ChlF and photosynthesis across\
        \ the growing season over different spatial scales (R2= 0.73, 0.77, and 0.86\
        \ at leaf, canopy, and satellite scales, respectively; P < 0.0001). We developed\
        \ a model to estimate GPP from the tower-based measurement of SIF and leaf-level\
        \ ChlF parameters. The estimation of GPP from this model agreed well with\
        \ flux tower observations of GPP (R2= 0.68; P < 0.0001), demonstrating the\
        \ potential of SIF for modeling GPP. At the leaf scale, we found that leaf\
        \ Fq\u2019/Fm\u2019, the fraction of absorbed photons that are used for photochemistry\
        \ for a light-adapted measurement from a pulse amplitude modulation fluorometer,\
        \ was the best leaf fluorescence parameter to correlate with canopy SIF yield\
        \ (SIF/APAR, R2= 0.79; P < 0.0001). We also found that canopy SIF and SIF-derived\
        \ GPP (GPPSIF) were strongly correlated to leaf-level biochemistry and canopy\
        \ structure, including chlorophyll content (R2= 0.65 for canopy GPPSIF and\
        \ chlorophyll content; P < 0.0001), leaf area index (LAI) (R2= 0.35 for canopy\
        \ GPPSIF and LAI; P < 0.0001), and normalized difference vegetation index\
        \ (NDVI) (R2= 0.36 for canopy GPPSIF and NDVI; P < 0.0001). Our results suggest\
        \ that ChlF can be a powerful tool to track photosynthetic rates at leaf,\
        \ canopy, and ecosystem scales."
