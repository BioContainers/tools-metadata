      abstract: "HHrep is a web server for the de novo identification of repeats in\
        \ protein sequences, which is based on the pairwise comparison of profile\
        \ hidden Markov models (HMMs). Its main strength is its sensitivity, allowing\
        \ it to detect highly divergent repeat units in protein sequences whose repeats\
        \ could as yet only be detected from their structures. Examples include sequences\
        \ with \u03B2-propellor fold, ferredoxin-like fold, double psi barrels or\
        \ (\u03B2\u03B1)8 (TIM) barrels. We illustrate this with proteins from four\
        \ superfamilies of TIM barrels by revealing a clear 4- and 8-fold symmetry,\
        \ which we detect solely from their sequences. This symmetry might be the\
        \ trace of an ancient origin through duplication of a \u03B2\u03B1\u03B2\u03B1\
        \ or \u03B2\u03B1 unit. HHrep can be accessed at http:// hhrep.tuebingen.mpg.de.\
