      abstract: The specificities of the UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N- acetylgalactosaminyltransferases
        which link the carbohydrate GalNAc to the side-chain of certain serine and
        threonine residues in mucin type glycoproteins, are presently unknown. The
        specificity seems to be modulated by sequence context, secondary structure
        and surface accessibility. The sequence context of glycosylated threonines
        was found to differ from that of serine, and the sites were found to cluster.
        Non-clustered sites had a sequence context different from that of clustered
        sites. Charged residues were disfavoured at position - 1 and +3. A jury of
        artificial neural networks was trained to recognize the sequence context and
        surface accessibility of 299 known and verified mucin type O-glycosylation
        sites extracted from O- GLYCBASE. The cross-validated NetOglyc network system
        correctly found 83% of the glycosylated and 90% of the non-glycosylated serine
        and threonine residues in independent test sets, thus proving more accurate
        than matrix statistics and vector projection methods. Predictions of O-glycosylation
        sites in the envelope glycoprotein gp120 from the primate lentiviruses HIV-
        1, HIV-2 and SIV are presented. The most conserved O-glycosylation signals
        in these evolutionary-related glycoproteins were found in their first hypervariable
        loop, V1. However, the strain variation for HIV-1 gp120 was significant. A
        computer server, available through WWW or E-mail, has been developed for prediction
        of mucin type O-glycosylation sites in proteins based on the amino acid sequence.

      abstract: O-GLYCBASE is an updated database of information on glycoproteins
        and their O-linked glycosylation sites. Entries are compiled and revised from
        the literature, and from the SWISS-PROT database. Entries include information
        about species, sequence, glycosylation sites and glycan type. O-GLYCBASE is
        now fully cross-referenced to the SWISS-PROT, PIR, PROSITE, PDB, EMBL, HSSP,
        LISTA and MIM databases. Compared with version 1.0 the number of entries have
        increased by 34%. Revision of the O-glycan assignment was performed on 20%
        of the entries. Sequence logos displaying the acceptor specificity patterns
        for the GalNAc, mannose and GlcNAc transferases are shown. The O-GLYCBASE
        database is available through WWW or by anonymous FTP.

      abstract: "The specificity of the enzyme(s) catalysing the covalent link between\
        \ the hydroxyl side chains of serine or threonine and the sugar moiety N-acetylgalactosamine\
        \ (GalNAc) is unknown. Pattern recognition by artificial neural networks and\
        \ weight matrix algorithms was performed to determine the exact position of\
        \ in vivo O-linked GalNAc-glycosylated serine and threonine residues from\
        \ the primary sequence exclusively. The acceptor sequence context for O-glycosylation\
        \ of serine was found to differ from that of threonine and the two types were\
        \ therefore treated separately. The context of the sites showed a high abundance\
        \ of proline, serine and threonine extending far beyond the previously reported\
        \ region covering positions -4 through +4 relative to the glycosylated residue.\
        \ The O-glycosylation sites were found to cluster and to have a high abundance\
        \ in the N-terminal part of the protein. The sites were also found to have\
        \ an increased preference for three different classes of \u03B2-turns. No\
        \ simple consensus-like rule could be deduced for the complex glycosylation\
        \ sequence acceptor patterns. The neural networks were trained on the hitherto\
        \ largest data material consisting of 48 carefully examined mammalian glycoproteins\
        \ comprising 264 O-glycosylation sites. For detection neural network algorithms\
        \ were much more reliable than weight matrices. The networks correctly found\
        \ 60-95% of the O-glycosylated serine/threonine residues and 88-97% of the\
        \ non-glycosylated residues in two independent test sets of known glycoproteins.\
        \ A computer server using E-mail for prediction of O-glycosylation sites has\
        \ been implemented and made publicly available."
