description: A tool that integrates methods to classify whether a SNV is deleterious
  or neutral. It can also be used to assess the impact of the mutation on the functionality
  of the mutant protein.

      abstract: "Several large ongoing initiatives that profit from next-generation\
        \ sequencing technologies have driven - and in coming years will continue\
        \ to drive - the emergence of long catalogs of missense single-nucleotide\
        \ variants (SNVs) in the human genome. As a consequence, researchers have\
        \ developed various methods and their related computational tools to classify\
        \ these missense SNVs as probably deleterious or probably neutral polymorphisms.\
        \ The outputs produced by each of these computational tools are of different\
        \ natures and thus difficult to compare and integrate. Taking advantage of\
        \ the possible complementarity between different tools might allow more accurate\
        \ classifications. Here we propose an effective approach to integrating the\
        \ output of some of these tools into a unified classification; this approach\
        \ is based on a weighted average of the normalized scores of the individual\
        \ methods (WAS). (In this paper, the approach is illustrated for the integration\
        \ of five tools.) We show that this WAS outperforms each individual method\
        \ in the task of classifying missense SNVs as deleterious or neutral. Furthermore,\
        \ we demonstrate that this WAS can be used not only for classification purposes\
        \ (deleterious versus neutral mutation) but also as an indicator of the impact\
        \ of the mutation on the functionality of the mutant protein. In other words,\
        \ it may be used as a deleteriousness score of missense SNVs. Therefore, we\
        \ recommend the use of this WAS as a consensus deleteriousness score of missense\
        \ mutations (Condel). \xA9 2011 The American Society of Human Genetics. All\
