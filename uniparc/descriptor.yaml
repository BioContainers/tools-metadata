    metadata:
      abstract: "Summary: UniProt Archive (UniParc) is the most comprehensive, non-redundant\
        \ protein sequence database available. Its protein sequences are retrieved\
        \ from predominant, publicly accessible resources. All new and updated protein\
        \ sequences are collected and loaded daily into UniParc for full coverage.\
        \ To avoid redundancy, each unique sequence is stored only once with a stable\
        \ protein identifier, which can be used later in UniParc to identify the same\
        \ protein in all source databases. When proteins are loaded into the database,\
        \ database cross-references are created to link them to the origins of the\
        \ sequences. As a result, performing a sequence search against UniParc is\
        \ equivalent to performing the same search against all databases cross-referenced\
        \ by UniParc. UniParc contains only protein sequences and database cross-references;\
        \ all other information must be retrieved from the source databases. \xA9\
