      abstract: "The conjugation of complex post-translational modifications (PTMs)\
        \ such as glycosylation and Small Ubiquitin-like Modification (SUMOylation)\
        \ to a substrate protein can substantially change the resulting peptide fragmentation\
        \ pattern compared to its unmodified counterpart, making current database\
        \ search methods inappropriate for the identification of tandem mass (MS/MS)\
        \ spectra from such modified peptides. Traditionally it has been difficult\
        \ to develop new algorithms to identify these atypical peptides because of\
        \ the lack of a large set of annotated spectra from which to learn the altered\
        \ fragmentation pattern. Using SUMOylation as an example, we propose a novel\
        \ approach to generate large MS/MS training data from modified peptides and\
        \ derive an algorithm that learns properties of PTM-specific fragmentation\
        \ from such training data. Benchmark tests on data sets of varying complexity\
        \ show that our method is 80-300% more sensitive than current state-of-the-art\
        \ approaches. The core concepts of our method are readily applicable to developing\
        \ algorithms for the identifications of peptides with other complex PTMs.\
