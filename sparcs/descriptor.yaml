      abstract: More than a simple carrier of the genetic information, messenger RNA
        (mRNA) coding regions can also harbor functional elements that evolved to
        control different post-transcriptional processes, such as mRNA splicing, localization
        and translation. Functional elements in RNA molecules are often encoded by
        secondary structure elements. In this aticle, we introduce Structural Profile
        Assignment of RNA Coding Sequences (SPARCS), an efficient method to analyze
        the (secondary) structure profile of protein-coding regions in mRNAs. First,
        we develop a novel algorithm that enables us to sample uniformly the sequence
        landscape preserving the dinucleotide frequency and the encoded amino acid
        sequence of the input mRNA. Then, we use this algorithm to generate a set
        of artificial sequences that is used to estimate the Z-score of classical
        structural metrics such as the sum of base pairing probabilities and the base
        pairing entropy. Finally, we use these metrics to predict structured and unstructured
        regions in the input mRNA sequence. We applied our methods to study the structural
        profile of the ASH1 genes and recovered key structural elements. A web server
        implementing this discovery pipeline is available at http://csb.cs.mcgill.ca/sparcs
        together with the source code of the sampling algorithm.
