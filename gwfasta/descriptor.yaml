      abstract: Similarity searches are a powerful method for solving important biological
        problems such as database scanning, evolutionary studies, gene prediction,
        and protein structure prediction. FASTA is a widely used sequence comparison
        tool for rapid database scanning. Here we describe the GWFASTA server that
        was developed to assist the FASTA user in similarity searches against partially
        and/or completely sequenced genomes. GWFASTA consists of more than 60 microbial
        genomes, eight eukaryote genomes, and proteomes of annotated genomes. In fact,
        it provides the maximum number of databases for similarity searching from
        a single platform. GWFASTA allows the submission of more than one sequence
        as a single query for a FASTA search. It also provides integrated post-processing
        of FASTA output, including compositional analysis of proteins, multiple sequences
        alignment, and phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, it summarizes the search
        results organism-wise for prokaryotes and chromosome-wise for eukaryotes.
        Thus, the integration of different tools for sequence analyses makes GWFASTA
        a powerful tool for biologists.
