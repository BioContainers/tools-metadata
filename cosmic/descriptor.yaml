description: Curates comprehensive information on somatic mutations in human cancer.
  Full scientific literature curations are available on 83 major cancer genes and
  49 fusion gene pairs. Biomart allows more automated data mining and integration
  with other biological databases. Annotation of genomic features has become a significant
  focus. It integrates many diverse types of mutation information and is making much
  closer links with Ensembl and other data resources.

      abstract: "COSMIC (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) curates comprehensive information\
        \ on somatic mutations in human cancer. Release v48 (July 2010) describes\
        \ over 136 000 coding mutations in almost 542 000 tumour samples; of the 18\
        \ 490 genes documented, 4803 (26%) have one or more mutations. Full scientific\
        \ literature curations are available on 83 major cancer genes and 49 fusion\
        \ gene pairs (19 new cancer genes and 30 new fusion pairs this year) and this\
        \ number is continually increasing. Key amongst these is TP53, now available\
        \ through a collaboration with the IARC p53 database. In addition to data\
        \ from the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) at the Sanger Institute, UK, and The\
        \ Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA), large systematic screens are also now\
        \ curated. Major website upgrades now make these data much more mineable,\
        \ with many new selection filters and graphics. A Biomart is now available\
        \ allowing more automated data mining and integration with other biological\
        \ databases. Annotation of genomic features has become a significant focus;\
        \ COSMIC has begun curating full-genome resequencing experiments, developing\
        \ new web pages, export formats and graphics styles. With all genomic information\
        \ recently updated to GRCh37, COSMIC integrates many diverse types of mutation\
        \ information and is making much closer links with Ensembl and other data\
        \ resources. \xA9 The Author(s) 2010."

      abstract: "The catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/)\
        \ is the largest public resource for information on somatically acquired mutations\
        \ in human cancer and is available freely without restrictions. Currently\
        \ (v43, August 2009), COSMIC contains details of 1.5-million experiments performed\
        \ through 13 423 genes in almost 370 000 tumours, describing over 90 000 individual\
        \ mutations. Data are gathered from two sources, publications in the scientific\
        \ literature, (v43 contains 7797 curated articles) and the full output of\
        \ the genome-wide screens from the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) at the Sanger\
        \ Institute, UK. Most of the world's literature on point mutations in human\
        \ cancer has now been curated into COSMIC and while this is continually updated,\
        \ a greater emphasis on curating fusion gene mutations is driving the expansion\
        \ of this information; over 2700 fusion gene mutations are now described.\
        \ Whole-genome sequencing screens are now identifying large numbers of genomic\
        \ rearrangements in cancer and COSMIC is now displaying details of these analyses\
        \ also. Examination of COSMIC's data is primarily web-driven, focused on providing\
        \ mutation range and frequency statistics based upon a choice of gene and/or\
        \ cancer phenotype. Graphical views provide easily interpretable summaries\
        \ of large quantities of data, and export functions can provide precise details\
        \ of user-selected data. \xA9 The Author(s) 2009. Published by Oxford University\
