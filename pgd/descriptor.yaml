description: This tool enables biologists to easily and flexibly query information
  about the conformation alone, the backbone geometry alone, and the relationships
  between them. It is valuable for assessing the uniqueness of observed conformational
  or geometric features in protein structure as well as discovering novel features
  and principles of protein structure.

      abstract: "The backbone bond lengths, bond angles, and planarity of a protein\
        \ are influenced by the backbone conformation (), but no tool exists to explore\
        \ these relationships, leaving this area as a reservoir of untapped information\
        \ about protein structure and function. The Protein Geometry Database (PGD)\
        \ enables biologists to easily and flexibly query information about the conformation\
        \ alone, the backbone geometry alone, and the relationships between them.\
        \ The capabilities the PGD provides are valuable for assessing the uniqueness\
        \ of observed conformational or geometric features in protein structure as\
        \ well as discovering novel features and principles of protein structure.\
        \ The PGD server is available at http://pgd.science.oregonstate.edu/ and the\
        \ data and code underlying it are freely available to use and extend. \xA9\
