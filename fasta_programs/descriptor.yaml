      abstract: "The FASTA program can search the NBRF protein sequence library (2.5\
        \ million residues) in less than 20 min on an IBM-PC microcomputer and unambiguously\
        \ detect proteins that shared a common ancestor billions of years in the past.\
        \ FASTA is both fast and selective because it initially considers only amino\
        \ acid identities. Its sensitivity is increased not only by using the PAM250\
        \ matrix to score and rescore regions with large numbers of identities but\
        \ also by joining initial regions. The results of searches with FASTA compare\
        \ favorably with results using NWS-based programs that are 100 times slower.\
        \ FASTA is slightly less sensitive but considerably more selective. It is\
        \ not clear that NWS-based programs would be more successful in finding distantly\
        \ related members of the G-protein-coupled receptor family. The joining step\
        \ by FASTA to calculate the initn score is especially useful for sequences\
        \ that share regions of sequence similarity that are separated by variable-length\
        \ loops. FASTP and FASTA were designed to identify protein sequences that\
        \ have descended from a common ancestor, and they have proved very useful\
        \ for this task. In many cases, a FASTA sequence search will result in a list\
        \ of high scoring library sequences that are homologous to the query sequence,\
        \ or the search will result in a list of sequences with similarity scores,\
        \ that cannot be distinguished from the bulk of the library. In either case,\
        \ the question of whether there are sequences in the library that are clearly\
        \ related to the query sequence has been answered unambiguously. Unfortunately,\
        \ the results often will not be so clear-cut, and careful analysis and the\
        \ biological context are required. In the course of analyzing the G-protein-coupled\
        \ receptor family, several proteins were found that, because with optimization,\
        \ appeared to be members of this family which were not previously recognized.\
        \ RDF2 analysis showed borderline z values, and only a careful examination\
        \ of the sequence alignments that focused on the conserved residues provided\
        \ convincing evidence that the high scores were fortuitous. As sequence comparison\
        \ methods become more powerful by becoming more sensitive, they become more\
        \ likely to mislead, and even greater care is required. \xA9 1990, Elsevier\

      abstract: We have developed three computer programs for comparisons of protein
        and DNA sequences. They can be used to search sequence data bases, evaluate
        similarity scores, and identify periodic structures based on local sequence
        similarity. The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP
        program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and
        can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating
        the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in
        the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple
        regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences.
        The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores
        using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA
        program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences
        with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and
        a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as
        a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs
        have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based
        on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.
