      abstract: "\xA9 2016 American Chemical Society. X!TandemPipeline is a software\
        \ designed to perform protein inference and to manage redundancy in the results\
        \ of phosphosite identification by database search. It provides the minimal\
        \ list of proteins or phosphosites that are present in a set of samples using\
        \ grouping algorithms based on the principle of parsimony. Regarding proteins,\
        \ a two-level classification is performed, where groups gather proteins sharing\
        \ at least one peptide and subgroups gather proteins that are not distinguishable\
        \ according to the identified peptides. Regarding phosphosites, an innovative\
        \ approach based on the concept of phosphoisland is used to gather overlapping\
        \ phosphopeptides. The graphical interface of X!TandemPipeline allows the\
        \ users to launch X!tandem identification, to inspect spectra and to manually\
        \ validate their assignment to peptides, to launch the grouping program, and\
        \ to visualize elementary data as well as grouping and redundancy information.\
        \ Identification results obtained from other search engines can also be processed.\
        \ X!TandemPipeline results can be exported as ready-to-use tabulated files\
        \ or as XML files that can be directly used by the PROTICdb database or by\
        \ the MassChroQ quantification software. X!TandemPipeline runs fast, is easy\
        \ to use, and can process hundreds of samples simultaneously. It is freely\
        \ available under the GNU General Public License v3.0 at http://pappso.inra.fr/bioinfo/xtandempipeline/."
