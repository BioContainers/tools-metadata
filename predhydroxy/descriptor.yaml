      abstract: "\xA9 The Royal Society of Chemistry.Compared to well-known and extensively\
        \ studied protein phosphorylation, protein hydroxylation attracts much less\
        \ attention and the molecular mechanism of the hydroxylation is still incompletely\
        \ understood. And yet annotation of hydroxylation in proteomes is a first-critical\
        \ step toward decoding protein function and understanding their physiological\
        \ roles that have been implicated in the pathological processes and providing\
        \ useful information for the drug designs of various diseases related with\
        \ hydroxylation. In this work, we present a novel method called PredHydroxy\
        \ to automate the prediction of the proline and lysine hydroxylation sites\
        \ based on position weight amino acids composition, 8 high-quality amino acid\
        \ indices and support vector machines. The PredHydroxy achieved a promising\
        \ performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\
        \ (AUC) of 82.72% and a Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 69.03%\
        \ for hydroxyproline as well as an AUC of 87.41% and a MCC of 66.68% for hydroxylysine\
        \ in jackknife cross-validation. The results obtained from both the cross\
        \ validation and independent tests suggest that the PredHydroxy might be a\
        \ powerful and complementary tool for further experimental investigation of\
        \ protein hydroxylation. Feature analyses demonstrate that hydroxylation and\
        \ non-hydroxylation have distinct location-specific differences; alpha and\
        \ turn propensity is of importance for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine\
        \ residues. A user-friendly server is freely available on the web at: http://bioinfo.ncu.edu.cn/PredHydroxy.aspx."
