      abstract: "\xA9 2017 The Author(s). Background: The success of the clinical\
        \ use of sequencing based tests (from single gene to genomes) depends on the\
        \ accuracy and consistency of variant interpretation. Aiming to improve the\
        \ interpretation process through practice guidelines, the American College\
        \ of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular\
        \ Pathology (AMP) have published standards and guidelines for the interpretation\
        \ of sequence variants. However, manual application of the guidelines is tedious\
        \ and prone to human error. Web-based tools and software systems may not only\
        \ address this problem but also document reasoning and supporting evidence,\
        \ thus enabling transparency of evidence-based reasoning and resolution of\
        \ discordant interpretations. Results: In this report, we describe the design,\
        \ implementation, and initial testing of the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen)\
        \ Pathogenicity Calculator, a configurable system and web service for the\
        \ assessment of pathogenicity of Mendelian germline sequence variants. The\
        \ system allows users to enter the applicable ACMG/AMP-style evidence tags\
        \ for a specific allele with links to supporting data for each tag and generate\
        \ guideline-based pathogenicity assessment for the allele. Through automation\
        \ and comprehensive documentation of evidence codes, the system facilitates\
        \ more accurate application of the ACMG/AMP guidelines, improves standardization\
        \ in variant classification, and facilitates collaborative resolution of discordances.\
        \ The rules of reasoning are configurable with gene-specific or disease-specific\
        \ guideline variations (e.g. cardiomyopathy-specific frequency thresholds\
        \ and functional assays). The software is modular, equipped with robust application\
        \ program interfaces (APIs), and available under a free open source license\
        \ and as a cloud-hosted web service, thus facilitating both stand-alone use\
        \ and integration with existing variant curation and interpretation systems.\
        \ The Pathogenicity Calculator is accessible at http://calculator.clinicalgenome.org.\
        \ Conclusions: By enabling evidence-based reasoning about the pathogenicity\
        \ of genetic variants and by documenting supporting evidence, the Calculator\
        \ contributes toward the creation of a knowledge commons and more accurate\
        \ interpretation of sequence variants in research and clinical care."
