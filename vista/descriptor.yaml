description: VISTA is a comprehensive suite of programs and databases for comparative
  analysis of genomic sequences. There are two ways of using VISTA - you can submit
  your own sequences and alignments for analysis (VISTA servers) or examine pre-computed
  whole-genome alignments of different species.

      abstract: "Motivation: The power of multi-sequence comparison for biological\
        \ discovery is well established. The need for new capabilities to visualize\
        \ and compare cross-species alignment data is intensified by the growing number\
        \ of genomic sequence datasets being generated for an ever-increasing number\
        \ of organisms. To be efficient these visualization algorithms must support\
        \ the ability to accommodate consistently a wide range of evolutionary distances\
        \ in a comparison framework based upon phylogenetic relationships. Results:\
        \ We have developed Phylo-VISTA, an interactive tool for analyzing multiple\
        \ alignments by visualizing a similarity measure for multiple DNA sequences.\
        \ The complexity of visual presentation is effectively organized using a framework\
        \ based upon interspecies phylogenetic relationships. The phylogenetic organization\
        \ supports rapid, user-guided interspecies comparison. To aid in navigation\
        \ through large sequence datasets, Phylo-VISTA leverages concepts from VISTA\
        \ that provide a user with the ability to select and view data at varying\
        \ resolutions. The combination of multiresolution data visualization and analysis,\
        \ combined with the phylogenetic framework for interspecies comparison, produces\
        \ a highly flexible and powerful tool for visual data analysis of multiple\
        \ sequence alignments. \xA9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved."

      abstract: "Motivation: To compare entire genomes from different species, biologists\
        \ increasingly need alignment methods that are efficient enough to handle\
        \ long sequences, and accurate enough to correctly align the conserved biological\
        \ features between distant species. The two main classes of pain/vise alignments\
        \ are global alignment, where one string is transformed into the other, and\
        \ local alignment, where all locations of similarity between the two strings\
        \ are returned. Global alignments are less prone to demonstrating false homology\
        \ as each letter of one sequence is constrained to being aligned to only one\
        \ letter of the other. Local alignments, on the other hand, can cope with\
        \ rearrangements between non-syntenic, orthologous sequences by identifying\
        \ similar regions in sequences; this, however, comes at the expense of a higher\
        \ false positive rate due to the inability of local aligners to take into\
        \ account overall conservation maps. Results: In this paper we introduce the\
        \ notion of glocal alignment, a combination of global and local methods, where\
        \ one creates a map that transforms one sequence into the other while allowing\
        \ for rearrangement events. We present Shuffle-LAGAN, a glocal alignment algorithm\
        \ that is based on the CHAOS local alignment algorithm and the LAGAN global\
        \ aligner, and is able to align long genomic sequences. To test Shuffle-LAGAN\
        \ we split the mouse genome into BAC-sized pieces, and aligned these pieces\
        \ to the human genome. We demonstrate that Shuffle-LAGAN compares favorably\
        \ in terms of sensitivity and specificity with standard local and global aligners.\
        \ From the alignments we conclude that about 9% of human/mouse homology may\
        \ be attributed to small rearrangements, 63% of which are duplications. Availability:\
        \ Our systems, supplemental information, and the alignment of the human and\
        \ mouse genomes using Shuffle-LAGAN are available at http://lagan.stanford.edu/glocal.\

      abstract: In this paper we describe a new global alignment method called AVID.
        The method is designed to be fast, memory efficient, and practical for sequence
        alignments of large genomic regions up to megabases long. We present numerous
        applications of the method, ranging from the comparison of assemblies to alignment
        of large syntenic genomic regions and whole genome human/mouse alignments.
        We have also performed a quantitative comparison of AVID with other popular
        alignment tools. To this end, we have established a format for the representation
        of alignments and methods for their comparison. These formats and methods
        should be useful for future studies. The tools we have developed for the alignment
        comparisons, as well as the AVID program, are publicly available. See Web
        Site References section for AVID Web address and Web addresses for other programs
        discussed in this paper.
