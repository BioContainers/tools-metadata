      abstract: "\xA9 2015.The Collaborative Computational Project for Electron cryo-Microscopy\
        \ (CCP-EM) has recently been established. The aims of the project are threefold:\
        \ to build a coherent cryoEM community which will provide support for individual\
        \ scientists and will act as a focal point for liaising with other communities,\
        \ to support practising scientists in their use of cryoEM software and finally\
        \ to support software developers in producing and disseminating robust and\
        \ user-friendly programs. The project is closely modelled on CCP4 for macromolecular\
        \ crystallography, and areas of common interest such as model fitting, underlying\
        \ software libraries and tools for building program packages are being exploited.\
        \ Nevertheless, cryoEM includes a number of techniques covering a large range\
        \ of resolutions and a distinct project is required. In this article, progress\
        \ so far is reported and future plans are discussed."
