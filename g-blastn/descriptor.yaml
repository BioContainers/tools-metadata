      abstract: "Motivation: Since 1990, the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST)\
        \ has become one of the most popular and fundamental bioinformatics tools\
        \ for sequence similarity searching, receiving extensive attention from the\
        \ research community. The two pioneering papers on BLAST have received over\
        \ 96 000 citations. Given the huge population of BLAST users and the increasing\
        \ size of sequence databases, an urgent topic of study is how to improve the\
        \ speed. Recently, graphics processing units (GPUs) have been widely used\
        \ as low-cost, high-performance computing platforms. The existing GPU-BLAST\
        \ is a promising software tool that uses a GPU to accelerate protein sequence\
        \ alignment. Unfortunately, there is still no GPU-accelerated software tool\
        \ for BLAST-based nucleotide sequence alignment. Results: We developed G-BLASTN,\
        \ a GPU-accelerated nucleotide alignment tool based on the widely used NCBI-BLAST.\
        \ G-BLASTN can produce exactly the same results as NCBI-BLAST, and it has\
        \ very similar user commands. Compared with the sequential NCBI-BLAST, G-BLASTN\
        \ can achieve an overall speedup of 14.80X under 'megablast' mode. More impressively,\
        \ it achieves an overall speedup of 7.15X over the multithreaded NCBI-BLAST\
        \ running on 4 CPU cores. When running under 'blastn' mode, the overall speedups\
        \ are 4.32X (against 1-core) and 1.56X (against 4-core). G-BLASTN also supports\
        \ a pipeline mode that further improves the overall performance by up to 44%\
        \ when handling a batch of queries as a whole. Currently G-BLASTN is best\
        \ optimized for databases with long sequences. We plan to optimize its performance\
        \ on short database sequences in our future work. \xA9 The Author 2014."
