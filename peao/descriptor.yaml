description: The Plant domain has been the subject of several attempts to structure
  and formally define terms and corresponding relations, such as their anatomical
  features, developmental stages, and the application of particular experimental procedures
  to a biological problem.  An ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental
  procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays. This
  ontology includes entities from three distinct realms (biological, physical and
  data), which include both experimental products, their relations and the protocols
  describing their manipulation.
