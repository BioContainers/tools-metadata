    abstract: © 2014 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Clustal Omega is a package for making
      multiple sequence alignments of amino acid or nucleotide sequences, quickly
      and accurately. It is a complete upgrade and rewrite of earlier Clustal programs.
      This unit describes how to run Clustal Omega interactively from a command line,
      although it can also be run online from several sites. The unit describes a
      basic protocol for taking a set of unaligned sequences and producing a full
      alignment. There are also protocols for using an external HMM or iteration to
      help improve an alignment.

    abstract: © The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf
      of Nucleic Acids Research. High-throughput data production technologies, particularly
      'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive
      changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced
      by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods,
      as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis
      in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform
      computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to
      address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational
      tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more
      accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment
      in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details
      automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report
      we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large
      scale.
