description: When sequencing several libraries simultaneously, the selection of compatible
  combinations of indexes is critical for ensuring that the sequencer will be able
  to decipher the short, sample-specific barcodes added to each fragment. However,
  researchers have few tools to help them choose optimal indexes. Here, we present
  checkMyIndex, an online R/Shiny application that facilitates the selection of the
  right indexes as a function of the experimental constraints.
