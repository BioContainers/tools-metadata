      abstract: "\xA9 2016 Lakiotaki et al. This is an open access article distributed\
        \ under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits\
        \ unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided\
        \ the original author and source are credited. One of the challenges that\
        \ arise from the advent of personal genomics services is to efficiently couple\
        \ individual data with state of the art Pharmacogenomics (PGx) knowledge.\
        \ Existing services are limited to either providing static views of PGx variants\
        \ or applying a simplistic match between individual genotypes and existing\
        \ PGx variants. Moreover, there is a considerable amount of haplotype variation\
        \ associated with drug metabolism that is currently insufficiently addressed.\
        \ Here, we present a web-based electronic Pharmacogenomics Assistant (ePGA;\
        \ http://www.epga.gr/) that provides personalized genotype-To-phenotype translation,\
        \ linked to state of the art clinical guidelines. ePGA's translation service\
        \ matches individual genotype-profiles with PGx gene haplotypes and infers\
        \ the corresponding diplotype and phenotype profiles, accompanied with summary\
        \ statistics. Additional features include i) the ability to customize translation\
        \ based on subsets of variants of clinical interest, and ii) to update the\
        \ knowledge base with novel PGx findings.We demonstrate ePGA's functionality\
        \ on genetic variation data from the 1000 Genomes Project."
