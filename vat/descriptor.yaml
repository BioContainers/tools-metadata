      abstract: "Molecular genetic testing informs diagnosis, prognosis, and risk\
        \ assessment for patients and their family members. Recent advances in low-cost,\
        \ high-throughput DNA sequencing and computing technologies have enabled the\
        \ rapid expansion of genetic test content, resulting in dramatically increased\
        \ numbers of DNA variants identified per test. To address this challenge,\
        \ our laboratory has developed a systematic approach to thorough and efficient\
        \ assessments of variants for pathogenicity determination. We first search\
        \ for existing data in publications and databases including internal, collaborative\
        \ and public resources. We then perform full evidence-based assessments through\
        \ statistical analyses of observations in the general population and disease\
        \ cohorts, evaluation of experimental data from in vivo or in vitro studies,\
        \ and computational predictions of potential impacts of each variant. Finally,\
        \ we weigh all evidence to reach an overall conclusion on the potential for\
        \ each variant to be disease causing. In this report, we highlight the principles\
        \ of variant assessment, address the caveats and pitfalls, and provide examples\
        \ to illustrate the process. By sharing our experience and providing a framework\
        \ for variant assessment, including access to a freely available customizable\
        \ tool, we hope to help move towards standardized and consistent approaches\
        \ to variant assessment. \xA9 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S."
