      abstract: "During the past decade, the field of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)\
        \ has greatly evolved, to a point where it has now been fully integrated by\
        \ most vendors as an optional or dedicated platform that can be purchased\
        \ with their instruments. However, the technology is not mature and multiple\
        \ research groups in both academia and industry are still very actively studying\
        \ the fundamentals of imaging techniques, adapting the technology to new ionization\
        \ sources, and developing new applications. As a result, there important varieties\
        \ of data file formats used to store mass spectrometry imaging data and, concurrent\
        \ to the development of MSi, collaborative efforts have been undertaken to\
        \ introduce common imaging data file formats. However, few free software packages\
        \ to read and analyze files of these different formats are readily available.\
        \ We introduce here MSiReader, a free open source application to read and\
        \ analyze high resolution MSI data from the most common MSi data formats.\
        \ The application is built on the Matlab platform (Mathworks, Natick, MA,\
        \ USA) and includes a large selection of data analysis tools and features.\
        \ People who are unfamiliar with the Matlab language will have little difficult\
        \ navigating the user-friendly interface, and users with Matlab programming\
        \ experience can adapt and customize MSiReader for their own needs. [Figure\
