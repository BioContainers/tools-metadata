    abstract: 'We describe a neural network system that predicts the locations of
      transmembrane helices in integral membrane proteins. By using evolutionary information
      as input to the network system, the method significantly improved on a previously
      published neural network prediction method that had been based on single sequence
      information. The input data were derived from multiple alignments for each position
      in a window of 13 adjacent residues: amino acid frequency, conservation weights,
      number of insertions and deletions, and position of the window with respect
      to the ends of the protein chain. Additional input was the amino acid composition
      and length of the whole protein. A rigorous cross‐validation test on 69 proteins
      with experimentally determined locations of transmembrane segments yielded an
      overall two‐state per‐residue accuracy of 95%. About 94% of all segments were
      predicted correctly. When applied to known globular proteins as a negative control,
      the network system incorrectly predicted fewer than 5% of globular proteins
      as having transmembrane helices. The method was applied to all 269 open reading
      frames from the complete yeast VIII chromosome. For 59 of these, at least two
      transmembrane helices were predicted. Thus, the prediction is that about one‐fourth
      of all proteins from yeast VIII contain one transmembrane helix, and some 20%,
      more than one. Copyright © 1995 The Protein Society'
