      abstract: "We find that the degree of impairment of protein function by missense\
        \ variants is predictable by comparative sequence analysis alone. The applicable\
        \ range of impairment is not confined to binary predictions that distinguish\
        \ normal from deleterious variants, but extends continuously from mild to\
        \ severe effects. The accuracy of predictions is strongly dependent on sequence\
        \ variation and is highest when diverse orthologs are available. High predictive\
        \ accuracy is achieved by quantification of the physicochemical characteristics\
        \ in each position of the protein, based on observed evolutionary variation.\
        \ The strong relationship between physicochemical characteristics of a missense\
        \ variant and impairment of protein function extends to human disease. By\
        \ using four diverse proteins for which sufficient comparative sequence data\
        \ are available, we show that grades of disease, or likelihood of developing\
        \ cancer, correlate strongly with physicochemical constraint violation by\
        \ causative amino acid variants. \xA92005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory\
