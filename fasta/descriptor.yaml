    abstract: The sensitivity and selectivity of the FASTA and the Smith-Waterman
      protein sequence comparison algorithms were evaluated using the superfamily
      classification provided in the National Biomedical Research Foundation/Protein
      Identification Resource (PIR) protein sequence database. Sequences from each
      of the 34 superfamilies in the PIR database with 20 or more members were compared
      against the protein sequence database. The similarity scores of the related
      and unrelated sequences were determined using either the FASTA program or the
      Smith-Waterman local similarity algorithm. These two sets of similarity scores
      were used to evaluate the ability of the two comparison algorithms to identify
      distantly related protein sequences. The FASTA program using the ktup = 2 sensitivity
      setting performed as well as the Smith-Waterman algorithm for 19 of the 34 superfamilies.
      Increasing the sensitivity by setting ktup = 1 allowed FASTA to perform as well
      as Smith-Waterman on an additional 7 superfamilies. The rigorous Smith-Waterman
      method performed better than FASTA with ktup = 1 on 8 superfamilies, including
      the globins, immunoglobulin variable regions, calmodulins, and plastocyanins.
      Several strategies for improving the sensitivity of FASTA were examined. The
      greatest improvement in sensitivity was achieved by optimizing a band around
      the best initial region found for every library sequence. For every superfamily
      except the globins and immunoglobulin variable regions, this strategy was as
      sensitive as a full Smith-Waterman. For some sequences, additional sensitivity
      was achieved by including conserved but nonidentical residues in the lookup
      table used to identify the initial region. Â© 1991.
