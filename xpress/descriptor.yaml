      abstract: 'An approach to the systematic identification and quantification of
        the proteins contained in the microsomal fraction of cells is described. It
        consists of three steps: (1) preparation of microsomal fractions from cells
        or tissues representing different states; (2) covalent tagging of the proteins
        with isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) reagents followed by proteolysis of
        the combined labeled protein samples; and (3) isolation, identification, and
        quantification of the tagged peptides by multidimensional chromatography,
        automated tandem mass spectrometry, and computational analysis of the obtained
        data. The method was used to identify and determine the ratios of abundance
        of each of 491 proteins contained in the microsomal fractions of naive and
        in vitrodifferentiated human myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells. The method and
        the new software tools to support it are well suited to the large-scale, quantitative
        analysis of membrane proteins and other classes of proteins that have been
        refractory to standard proteomics technology.'
