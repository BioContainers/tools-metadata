      abstract: "Background: Efficient analysis of results from mass spectrometry-based\
        \ proteomics experiments requires access to disparate data types, including\
        \ native mass spectrometry files, output from algorithms that assign peptide\
        \ sequence to MS/MS spectra, and annotation for proteins and pathways from\
        \ various database sources. Moreover, proteomics technologies and experimental\
        \ methods are not yet standardized; hence a high degree of flexibility is\
        \ necessary for efficient support of high- and low-throughput data analytic\
        \ tasks. Development of a desktop environment that is sufficiently robust\
        \ for deployment in data analytic pipelines, and simultaneously supports customization\
        \ for programmers and non-programmers alike, has proven to be a significant\
        \ challenge. Results: We describe multiplierz, a flexible and open-source\
        \ desktop environment for comprehensive proteomics data analysis. We use this\
        \ framework to expose a prototype version of our recently proposed common\
        \ API (mzAPI) designed for direct access to proprietary mass spectrometry\
        \ files. In addition to routine data analytic tasks, multiplierz supports\
        \ generation of information rich, portable spreadsheet-based reports. Moreover,\
        \ multiplierz is designed around a \"zero infrastructure\" philosophy, meaning\
        \ that it can be deployed by end users with little or no system administration\
        \ support. Finally, access to multiplierz functionality is provided via high-level\
        \ Python scripts, resulting in a fully extensible data analytic environment\
        \ for rapid development of custom algorithms and deployment of high-throughput\
        \ data pipelines. Conclusion: Collectively, mzAPI and multiplierz facilitate\
        \ a wide range of data analysis tasks, spanning technology development to\
        \ biological annotation, for mass spectrometry-based proteomics research.\
