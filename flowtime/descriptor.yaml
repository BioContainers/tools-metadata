description: This package was developed for analysis of both dynamic and steady state
  experiments examining the function of gene regulatory networks in yeast (strain
  W303) expressing fluorescent reporter proteins using a BD Accuri C6 and SORP cytometers.
  However, the functions are for the most part general and may be adapted for analysis
  of other organisms using other flow cytometers.
