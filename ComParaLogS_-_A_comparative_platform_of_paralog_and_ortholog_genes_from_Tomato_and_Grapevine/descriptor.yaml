description: A comparative platform on grapevine and tomato reporting paralog and
  related ortholog genes identified with an analytical, dedicated, procedure. It provides
  an update on functional annotations from the two species and it represents an internationally
  unique platform. It is in expansion in order to include other species, useful to
  study fruit development  (Ambrosino et al., 2018; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2420-y).
