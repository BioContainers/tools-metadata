description: 16S subunit related sequences database, identified from metagenomic efforts
  as part of the Tara Oceans project. It includes a BLAST search tool. The analysis
  system incorporates the SILVA collection, allowing comparative analyses to identify
  unclassified sequences and their geographical distribution.

      abstract: "\xA9 2018 The Author(s). Background: Environmental metagenomics is\
        \ a challenging approach that is exponentially spreading in the scientific\
        \ community to investigate taxonomic diversity and possible functions of the\
        \ biological components. The massive amount of sequence data produced, often\
        \ endowed with rich environmental metadata, needs suitable computational tools\
        \ to fully explore the embedded information. Bioinformatics plays a key role\
        \ in providing methodologies to manage, process and mine molecular data, integrated\
        \ with environmental metagenomics collections. One such relevant example is\
        \ represented by the Tara Ocean Project. Results: We considered the Tara 16S\
        \ miTAGs released by the consortium, representing raw sequences from a shotgun\
        \ metagenomics approach with similarities to 16S rRNA genes. We generated\
        \ assembled 16S rDNA sequences, which were classified according to their lengths,\
        \ the possible presence of chimeric reads, the putative taxonomic affiliation.\
        \ The dataset was included in GLOSSary (the GLobal Ocean 16S Subunit web accessible\
        \ resource), a bioinformatics platform to organize environmental metagenomics\
        \ data. The aims of this work were: i) to present alternative computational\
        \ approaches to manage challenging metagenomics data; ii) to set up user friendly\
        \ web-based platforms to allow the integration of environmental metagenomics\
        \ sequences and of the associated metadata; iii) to implement an appropriate\
        \ bioinformatics platform supporting the analysis of 16S rDNA sequences exploiting\
        \ reference datasets, such as the SILVA database. We organized the data in\
        \ a next-generation NoSQL \"schema-less\" database, allowing flexible organization\
        \ of large amounts of data and supporting native geospatial queries. A web\
        \ interface was developed to permit an interactive exploration and a visual\
        \ geographical localization of the data, either raw miTAG reads or 16S contigs,\
        \ from our processing pipeline. Information on unassembled sequences is also\
        \ available. The taxonomic affiliations of contigs and miTAGs, and the spatial\
        \ distribution of the sampling sites and their associated sequence libraries,\
        \ as they are contained in the Tara metadata, can be explored by a query interface,\
        \ which allows both textual and visual investigations. In addition, all the\
        \ sequence data were made available for a dedicated BLAST-based web application\
        \ alongside the SILVA collection. Conclusions: GLOSSary provides an expandable\
        \ bioinformatics environment, able to support the scientific community in\
        \ current and forthcoming environmental metagenomics analyses."
