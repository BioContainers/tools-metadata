description: Fast k-mer distance estimation enabled by mash to calculate core and
  accessory distances between all pairs of isolates of bacteria in a collection. By
  clustering these distances into ‘within-strain’ and ‘between-strain’ distances a
  network of within-strain comparisons can be constructed.
