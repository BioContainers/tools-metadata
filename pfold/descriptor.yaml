      abstract: 'Motivation: Many computerized methods for RNA secondary structure
        prediction have been developed. Few of these methods, however, employ an evolutionary
        model, thus relevant information is often left out from the structure determination.
        This paper introduces a method which incorporates evolutionary history into
        RNA secondary structure prediction. The method reported here is based on stochastic
        context-free grammars (SCFGs) to give a prior probability distribution of
        structures. Results: The phylogenetic tree relating the sequences can be found
        by maximum likelihood (ML) estimation from the model introduced here. The
        tree is shown to reveal information about the structure, due to mutation patterns.
        The inclusion of a prior distribution of RNA structures ensures good structure
        predictions even for a small number of related sequences. Prediction is carried
        out using maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) estimation in a Bayesian approach.
        For small sequence sets, the method performs very well compared to current
        automated methods.'
