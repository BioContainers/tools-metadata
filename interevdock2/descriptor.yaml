      abstract: "\xA9 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on\
        \ behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. Computational protein docking is a powerful\
        \ strategy to predict structures of protein-protein interactions and provides\
        \ crucial insights for the functional characterization of macromolecular cross-talks.\
        \ We previously developed InterEvDock, a server for ab initio protein docking\
        \ based on rigid-body sampling followed by consensus scoring using physics-based\
        \ and statistical potentials, including the InterEvScore function specifically\
        \ developed to incorporate co-evolutionary information in docking. InterEvDock2\
        \ is a major evolution of InterEvDock which allows users to submit input sequences\
        \ - not only structures - and multimeric inputs and to specify constraints\
        \ for the pairwise docking process based on previous knowledge about the interaction.\
        \ For this purpose, we added modules in InterEvDock2 for automatic template\
        \ search and comparative modeling of the input proteins. The InterEvDock2\
        \ pipeline was benchmarked on 812 complexes for which unbound homology models\
        \ of the two partners and co-evolutionary information are available in the\
        \ PPI4DOCK database. InterEvDock2 identified a correct model among the top\
        \ 10 consensus in 29% of these cases (compared to 15-24% for individual scoring\
        \ functions) and at least one correct interface residue among 10 predicted\
        \ in 91% of these cases. InterEvDock2 is thus a unique protein docking server,\
        \ designed to be useful for the experimental biology community. The InterEvDock2\
        \ web interface is available at http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-Paris-diderot.fr/services/InterEvDock2/."
