      abstract: "\xA9 2018 The Author(s).Background: Cell surface proteins have provided\
        \ useful targets and biomarkers for advanced cancer therapies. The recent\
        \ clinical success of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) highlights the importance\
        \ of finding selective surface antigens for given cancer subtypes. We thus\
        \ attempted to develop stand-alone software for the analysis of the cell surface\
        \ transcriptome of patient cancer samples and to prioritize lineage- and/or\
        \ mutation-specific over-expression markers in cancer cells. Results: A total\
        \ of 519 genes were selected as surface proteins, and their expression was\
        \ profiled in 14 cancer subtypes using patient sample transcriptome data.\
        \ Lineage/mutation-oriented analysis was used to identify subtype-specific\
        \ surface markers with statistical confidence. Experimental validation confirmed\
        \ the unique over-expression of predicted surface markers (MUC4, MSLN, and\
        \ SLC7A11) in lung cancer cells at the protein level. The differential cell\
        \ surface gene expression of cell lines may differ from that of tissue samples\
        \ due to the absence of the tumor microenvironment. Conclusions: In the present\
        \ study, advanced 3D models of lung cell lines successfully reproduced the\
        \ predicted patterns, demonstrating the physiological relevance of cell line-based\
        \ 3D models in validating surface markers from patient tumor data. Also QSurface\
        \ software is freely available at http://compbio.sookmyung.ac.kr/~qsurface."
