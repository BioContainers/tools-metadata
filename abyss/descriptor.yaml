      abstract: "Widespread adoption of massively parallel deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\
        \ sequencing instruments has prompted the recent development of de novo short\
        \ read assembly algorithms. A common shortcoming of the available tools is\
        \ their inability to efficiently assemble vast amounts of data generated from\
        \ large-scale sequencing projects, such as the sequencing of individual human\
        \ genomes to catalog natural genetic variation. To address this limitation,\
        \ we developed ABySS (Assembly By Short Sequences), a parallelized sequence\
        \ assembler. As a demonstration of the capability of our software, we assembled\
        \ 3.5 billion paired-end reads from the genome of an African male publicly\
        \ released by Illumina, Inc. Approximately 2.76 million contigs \u2265100\
        \ base pairs (bp) in length were created with an N50 size of 1499 bp, representing\
        \ 68% of the reference human genome. Analysis of these contigs identified\
        \ polymorphic and novel sequences not present in the human reference assembly,\
        \ which were validated by alignment to alternate human assemblies and to other\
        \ primate genomes. \xA9 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
