      abstract: "\xA9 2016 American Chemical Society. Chemical cross-linking coupled\
        \ with mass spectrometry plays an important role in unravelling protein interactions,\
        \ especially weak and transient ones. Moreover, cross-linking complements\
        \ several structural determination approaches such as cryo-EM. Although several\
        \ computational approaches are available for the annotation of spectra obtained\
        \ from cross-linked peptides, there remains room for improvement. Here, we\
        \ present Xilmass, a novel algorithm to identify cross-linked peptides that\
        \ introduces two new concepts: (i) the cross-linked peptides are represented\
        \ in the search database such that the cross-linking sites are explicitly\
        \ encoded, and (ii) the scoring function derived from the Andromeda algorithm\
        \ was adapted to score against a theoretical tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)\
        \ spectrum that contains the peaks from all possible fragment ions of a cross-linked\
        \ peptide pair. The performance of Xilmass was evaluated against the recently\
        \ published Kojak and the popular pLink algorithms on a calmodulin-plectin\
        \ complex data set, as well as three additional, published data sets. The\
        \ results show that Xilmass typically had the highest number of identified\
        \ distinct cross-linked sites and also the highest number of predicted cross-linked\
        \ sites."
