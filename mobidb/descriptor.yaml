    abstract: '© The Author(s) 2014.MobiDB (http://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/) is a database
      of intrinsically disordered and mobile proteins. Intrinsically disordered regions
      are key for the function of numerous proteins. Here we provide a new version
      of MobiDB, a centralized source aimed at providing the most complete picture
      on different flavors of disorder in protein structures covering all UniProt
      sequences (currently over 80 million). The database features three levels of
      annotation: manually curated, indirect and predicted. Manually curated data
      is extracted from the DisProt database. Indirect data is inferred from PDB structures
      that are considered an indication of intrinsic disorder. The 10 predictors currently
      included (three ESpritz flavors, two IUPred flavors, two DisEMBL flavors, GlobPlot,
      VSL2b and JRONN) enable MobiDB to provide disorder annotations for every protein
      in absence of more reliable data. The new version also features a consensus
      annotation and classification for long disordered regions. In order to complement
      the disorder annotations, MobiDB features additional annotations from external
      sources. Annotations from the UniProt database include post-translational modifications
      and linear motifs. Pfam annotations are displayed in graphical form and are
      link-enabled, allowing the user to visit the corresponding Pfam page for further
      information. Experimental protein-protein interactions from STRING are also
      classified for disorder content.'

    abstract: 'Motivation: Disordered protein regions are key to the function of numerous
      processes within an organism and to the determination of a protein''s biological
      role. The most common source for protein disorder annotations, DisProt, covers
      only a fraction of the available sequences. Alternatively, the Protein Data
      Bank (PDB) has been mined for missing residues in X-ray crystallographic structures.
      Herein, we provide a centralized source for data on different flavours of disorder
      in protein structures, MobiDB, building on and expanding the content provided
      by already existing sources. In addition to the DisProt and PDB X-ray structures,
      we have added experimental information from NMR structures and five different
      flavours of two disorder predictors (ESpritz and IUpred). These are combined
      into a weighted consensus disorder used to classify disordered regions into
      flexible and constrained disorder. Users are encouraged to submit manual annotations
      through a submission form. MobiDB features experimental annotations for 17 285
      proteins, covering the entire PDB and predictions for the SwissProt database,
      with 565 200 annotated sequences. Depending on the disorder flavour, 6-20% of
      the residues are predicted as disordered. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford
