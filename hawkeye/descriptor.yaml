    abstract: Genome sequencing remains an inexact science, and genome sequences can
      contain significant errors if they are not carefully examined. Hawkeye is our
      new visual analytics tool for genome assemblies, designed to aid in identifying
      and correcting assembly errors. Users can analyze all levels of an assembly
      along with summary statistics and assembly metrics, and are guided by a ranking
      component towards likely mis-assemblies. Hawkeye is freely available and released
      as part of the open source AMOS project http://amos.sourceforge.net/hawkeye.
