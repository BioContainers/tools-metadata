      abstract: "\xA9 2015 Meier, S\xF6ding.Homology modeling predicts the 3D structure\
        \ of a query protein based on the sequence alignment with one or more template\
        \ proteins of known structure. Its great importance for biological research\
        \ is owed to its speed, simplicity, reliability and wide applicability, covering\
        \ more than half of the residues in protein sequence space. Although multiple\
        \ templates have been shown to generally increase model quality over single\
        \ templates, the information from multiple templates has so far been combined\
        \ using empirically motivated, heuristic approaches. We present here a rigorous\
        \ statistical framework for multi-template homology modeling. First, we find\
        \ that the query proteins\u2019 atomic distance restraints can be accurately\
        \ described by two-component Gaussian mixtures. This insight allowed us to\
        \ apply the standard laws of probability theory to combine restraints from\
        \ multiple templates. Second, we derive theoretically optimal weights to correct\
        \ for the redundancy among related templates. Third, a heuristic template\
        \ selection strategy is proposed. We improve the average GDT-ha model quality\
        \ score by 11% over single template modeling and by 6.5% over a conventional\
        \ multi-template approach on a set of 1000 query proteins. Robustness with\
        \ respect to wrong constraints is likewise improved. We have integrated our\
        \ multi-template modeling approach with the popular MODELLER homology modeling\
        \ software in our free HHpred server http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred\
        \ and also offer open source software for running MODELLER with the new restraints\
        \ at https://bitbucket.org/soedinglab/hh-suite."
