      abstract: "Copyright \xA9 2018 American Chemical Society.Targeted proteomics\
        \ experiments based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) have gained wide\
        \ adoption in the use of clinical biomarkers, cellular modeling, and numerous\
        \ other biological experiments due to their highly accurate and reproducible\
        \ quantification. The quantitative accuracy in targeted proteomics experiments\
        \ is reliant on the stable-isotope, heavy-labeled peptide standards that are\
        \ spiked into a sample and used as a reference when calculating the abundance\
        \ of endogenous peptides. Therefore, the quality of measurement for these\
        \ standards is a critical factor in determining whether data acquisition was\
        \ successful. With improved mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation that enables\
        \ the monitoring of hundreds of peptides in hundreds to thousands of samples,\
        \ quality assessment is increasingly important and cannot be performed manually.\
        \ We present Q4SRM, a software tool that rapidly checks the signal from all\
        \ heavy-labeled peptides and flags those that fail quality-control metrics.\
        \ Using four metrics, the tool detects problems with both individual SRM transitions\
        \ and the collective group of transitions that monitor a single peptide. The\
        \ program's speed and simplicity enable its use at the point of data acquisition\
        \ and can be ideally run immediately upon the completion of a liquid chromatography-SRM-MS\
        \ analysis."
