      abstract: "\xA9 2016 American Chemical Society. Despite many technological and\
        \ computational advances, the results of a mass spectrometry proteomics experiment\
        \ are still subject to a large variability. For the understanding and evaluation\
        \ of how technical variability affects the results of an experiment, several\
        \ computationally derived quality control metrics have been introduced. However,\
        \ despite the availability of these metrics, a systematic approach to quality\
        \ control is often still lacking because the metrics are not fully understood\
        \ and are hard to interpret. Here, we present a toolkit of powerful techniques\
        \ to analyze and interpret multivariate quality control metrics to assess\
        \ the quality of mass spectrometry proteomics experiments. We show how unsupervised\
        \ techniques applied to these quality control metrics can provide an initial\
        \ discrimination between low-quality experiments and high-quality experiments\
        \ prior to manual investigation. Furthermore, we provide a technique to obtain\
        \ detailed information on the quality control metrics that are related to\
        \ the decreased performance, which can be used as actionable information to\
        \ improve the experimental setup. Our toolkit is released as open-source and\
        \ can be downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/proteinspector/qc-analysis/."
