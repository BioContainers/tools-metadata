      abstract: "Recent improvements in technology have made DNA sequencing dramatically\
        \ faster and more efficient than ever before. The new technologies produce\
        \ highly accurate sequences, but one drawback is that the most efficient technology\
        \ produces the shortest read lengths. Short-read sequencing has been applied\
        \ successfully to resequence the human genome and those of other species but\
        \ not to whole-genome sequencing of novel organisms. Here we describe the\
        \ sequencing and assembly of a novel clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,\
        \ strain PAb1, using very short read technology. From 8,627,900 reads, each\
        \ 33 nucleotides in length, we assembled the genome into one scaffold of 76\
        \ ordered contiguous sequences containing 6,290,005 nucleotides, including\
        \ one contig spanning 512,638 nucleotides, plus an additional 436 unordered\
        \ contigs containing 416,897 nucleotides. Our method includes a novel gene-boosting\
        \ algorithm that uses amino acid sequences from predicted proteins to build\
        \ a better assembly. This study demonstrates the feasibility of very short\
        \ read sequencing for the sequencing of bacterial genomes, particularly those\
        \ for which a related species has been sequenced previously, and expands the\
        \ potential application of this new technology to most known prokaryotic species.\
