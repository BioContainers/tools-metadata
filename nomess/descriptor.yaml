      abstract: "\xA9 The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press. Summary:\
        \ To enable mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic studies with poorly characterized\
        \ organisms, we developed a computational workflow for the homology-driven\
        \ assembly of a non-redundant reference sequence dataset. In the automated\
        \ pipeline, translated DNA sequences (e.g. ESTs, RNA deep-sequencing data)\
        \ are aligned to those of a closely related and fully sequenced organism.\
        \ Representative sequences are derived from each cluster and joined, resulting\
        \ in a non-redundant reference set representing the maximal available amino\
        \ acid sequence information for each protein. We here applied NOmESS to assemble\
        \ a reference database for the widely used model organism Xenopus laevis and\
        \ demonstrate its use in proteomic applications."
