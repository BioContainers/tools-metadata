    metadata:
      abstract: "A method has been developed to predict the effects of mutations in\
        \ the p53 cancer suppressor gene. The new method uses novel parameters combined\
        \ with previously established parameters. The most important parameter is\
        \ the stability measure of the mutated structure calculated using molecular\
        \ modelling. For each mutant, a severity score is reported, which can be used\
        \ for classification into deleterious and nondeleterious. Both structural\
        \ features and sequence properties are taken into account. The method has\
        \ a prediction accuracy of 77% on all mutants and 88% on breast cancer mutations\
        \ affecting WAF1 promoter binding. When compared with earlier methods, using\
        \ the same dataset, our method clearly performs better. As a result of the\
        \ severity score calculated for every mutant, valuable knowledge can be gained\
        \ regarding p53, a protein that is believed to be involved in over 50% of\
        \ all human cancers. \xA9 2009 FEBS."
