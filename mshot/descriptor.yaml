description: This addition to ms, called msHOT, allows for implementation of multiple
  crossover hotspots and/or multiple gene conversion hotspots in the simulated genetic
  region. Crossover hotspots may overlap with gene conver-sion hotspots, but crossover
  hotspots may not overlap with each other and gene conversion hotspots may not overlap
  with each other.
