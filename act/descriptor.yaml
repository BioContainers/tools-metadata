      abstract: "The Arabidopsis Co-expression Tool, ACT, ranks the genes across a\
        \ large microarray dataset according to how closely their expression follows\
        \ the expression of a query gene. A database stores pre-calculated co-expression\
        \ results for \u223C21 800 genes based on data from over 300 arrays. These\
        \ results can be corroborated by calculation of co-expression results for\
        \ user-defined sub-sets of arrays or experiments from the NASC/GARNet array\
        \ dataset. Clique Finder (CF) identifies groups of genes which are consistently\
        \ co-expressed with each other across a user-defined co-expression list. The\
        \ parameters can be altered easily to adjust cluster size and the output examined\
        \ for optimal inclusion of genes with known biological roles. Alternatively,\
        \ a Scatter Plot tool displays the correlation coefficients for all genes\
        \ against two user-selected queries on a scatter plot which can be useful\
        \ for visual identification of clusters of genes with similar r-values. User-input\
        \ groups of genes can be highlighted on the scatter plots. Inclusion of genes\
        \ with known biology in sets of genes identified using CF and Scatter Plot\
        \ tools allows inferences to be made about the roles of the other genes in\
        \ the set and both tools can therefore be used to generate short lists of\
        \ genes for further characterization. ACT is freely available at www.Arabidopsis.leeds.ac.uk/ACT.\

      abstract: "We present a new WWW-based tool for plant gene analysis, the Arabidopsis\
        \ Co-Expression Tool (ACT), based on a large Arabidopsis thaliana microarray\
        \ data set obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre. The co-expression\
        \ analysis tool allows users to identify genes whose expression patterns are\
        \ correlated across selected experiments or the complete data set. Results\
        \ are accompanied by estimates of the statistical significance of the correlation\
        \ relationships, expressed as probability (P) and expectation (E) values.\
        \ Additionally, highly ranked genes on a correlation list can be examined\
        \ using the novel CLIQUE FINDER tool to determine the sets of genes most likely\
        \ to be regulated in a similar manner. In combination, these tools offer three\
        \ levels of analysis: creation of correlation lists of co-expressed genes,\
        \ refinement of these lists using two-dimensional scatter plots, and dissection\
        \ into cliques of co-regulated genes. We illustrate the applications of the\
        \ software by analysing genes encoding functionally related proteins, as well\
        \ as pathways involved in plant responses to environmental stimuli. These\
        \ analyses demonstrate novel biological relationships underlying the observed\
        \ gene co-expression patterns. To demonstrate the ability of the software\
        \ to develop testable hypotheses on gene function within a defined biological\
        \ process we have used the example of cell wall biosynthesis genes. The resource\
        \ is freely available at http://www.arabidopsis.leeds.ac.uk/ACT/. \xA9 2006\
