description: "Computationally efficient tools for modeling genetic ancestry based\
  \ in the SNP information. \_GemTools is a package of functions to help the user\
  \ account for genetic ancestry of a large number of individuals using spectral graph\
  \ theory and projections to break a large problem into smaller pieces and calculate\
  \ genetic ancestry information efficiently, i.e., a divide and conquer (dac) strategy."

      abstract: We studied human population structure using genotypes at 377 autosomal
        microsatellite loci in 1056 individuals from 52 populations. Within-population
        differences among individuals account for 93 to 95% of genetic variation;
        differences among major groups constitute only 3 to 5%. Nevertheless, without
        using prior information about the origins of individuals, we identified six
        main genetic clusters, five of which correspond to major geographic regions,
        and subclusters that often correspond to individual populations. General agreement
        of genetic and predefined populations suggests that self-reported ancestry
        can facilitate assessments of epidemiological risks but does not obviate the
        need to use genetic information in genetic association studies.
