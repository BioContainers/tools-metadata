description: Absolute protein expression Quantitative Proteomics Tool, is a free and
  open source Java implementation of the APEX technique for the quantitation of proteins
  based on standard LC- MS/MS proteomics data. This technique uses machine learning
  algorithms to help correct for variable peptide detection related to certain peptide
  physicochemical properties which favor or hinder detection. A sample data set and
  descriptive tutorial help to acquaint users with the operation of the tool.

      abstract: "We report a method for large-scale absolute protein expression measurements\
        \ (APEX) and apply it to estimate the relative contributions of transcriptional-\
        \ and translational-level gene regulation in the yeast and Escherichia coli\
        \ proteomes. APEX relies upon correcting each protein's mass spectrometry\
        \ sampling depth (observed peptide count) by learned probabilities for identifying\
        \ the peptides. APEX abundances agree with measurements from controls, western\
        \ blotting, flow cytometry and two-dimensional gels, as well as known correlations\
        \ with mRNA abundances and codon bias, providing absolute protein concentrations\
        \ across approximately three to four orders of magnitude. Using APEX, we demonstrate\
        \ that 73% of the variance in yeast protein abundance (47% in E. coli) is\
        \ explained by mRNA abundance, with the number of proteins per mRNA log-normally\
        \ distributed about \u223C5,600 (\u223C540 in E. coli) protein molecules/mRNA.\
        \ Therefore, levels of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are set per\
        \ mRNA molecule and independently of overall protein concentration, with >70%\
        \ of yeast gene expression regulation occurring through mRNA-directed mechanisms.\
