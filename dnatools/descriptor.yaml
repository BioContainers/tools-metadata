      abstract: The WWW servers at http://www.icgeb.trieste.it/dna/ are dedicated
        to the analysis of user-submitted DNA sequences; plot.it creates parametric
        plots of 45 physicochemical, as well as statistical, parameters; bend.it calculates
        DNA curvature according to various methods. Both programs provide 1D as well
        as 2D plots that allow localisation of peculiar segments within the query.
        The server model.it creates 3D models of canonical or bent DNA starting from
        sequence data and presents the results in the form of a standard PDB file,
        directly viewable on the user's PC using any molecule manipulation program.
        The recently established introns server allows statistical evaluation of introns
        in various taxonomic groups and the comparison of taxonomic groups in terms
        of length, base composition, intron type etc. The options include the analysis
        of splice sites and a probability test for exon-shuffling.
