      abstract: "miRNAs are small, non-coding RNA that negatively regulate gene expression\
        \ at post-transcriptional level, which play crucial roles in various physiological\
        \ and pathological processes, such as development and tumorigenesis. Although\
        \ deep sequencing technologies have been applied to investigate various small\
        \ RNA transcriptomes, their computational methods are far away from maturation\
        \ as compared to microarray-based approaches. In this study, a comprehensive\
        \ web server mirTools was developed to allow researchers to comprehensively\
        \ characterize small RNA transcriptome. With the aid of mirTools, users can:\
        \ (i) filter low-quality reads and 3/50 adapters from raw sequenced data;\
        \ (ii) align large-scale short reads to the reference genome and explore their\
        \ length distribution; (iii) classify small RNA candidates into known categories,\
        \ such as known miRNAs, non-coding RNA, genomic repeats and coding sequences;\
        \ (iv) provide detailed annotation information for known miRNAs, such as miRNA/miRNA,\
        \ absolute/relative reads count and the most abundant tag; (v) predict novel\
        \ miRNAs that have not been characterized before; and (vi) identify differentially\
        \ expressed miRNAs between samples based on two different counting strategies:\
        \ total read tag counts and the most abundant tag counts. We believe that\
        \ the integration of multiple computational approaches in mirTools will greatly\
        \ facilitate current microRNA researches in multiple ways. mirTools can be\
        \ accessed at http://centre.bioinformatics.zj.cn/mirtools/ and http://59.79.168.90/mirtools.\
