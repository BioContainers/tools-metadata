      abstract: In order to understand the functioning of organisms on the molecular
        level, we need to know which genes are expressed, when and where in the organism,
        and to which extent. The regulation of gene expression is achieved through
        genetic regulatory systems structured by networks of interactions between
        DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules. As most genetic regulatory networks
        of interest involve many components connected through interlocking positive
        and negative feedback loops, an intuitive understanding of their dynamics
        is hard to obtain. As a consequence, formal methods and computer tools for
        the modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory networks will be indispensable.
        This paper reviews formalisms that have been employed in mathematical biology
        and bioinformatics to describe genetic regulatory systems, in particular directed
        graphs, Bayesian networks, Boolean networks and their generalizations, ordinary
        and partial differential equations, qualitative differential equations, stochastic
        equations, and rule-based formalisms. In addition, the paper discusses how
        these formalisms have been used in the simulation of the behavior of actual
        regulatory systems.

        \ biological networks, for which detailed kinetic data are scarce. This chapter\
        \ introduces the reader to a well-established qualitative (logical) framework\
        \ for the modelling of regulatory networks. Relying on GINsim, a software\
        \ implementing this logical formalism, we guide the reader step by step towards\
