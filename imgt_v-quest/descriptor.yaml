      abstract: IMGT/V-QUEST is the highly customized and integrated system for the
        standardized analysis of the immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR)
        rearranged nucleotide sequences. IMGT/V-QUEST identifies the variable (V),
        diversity (D) and joining (J) genes and alleles by alignment with the germline
        IG and TR gene and allele sequences of the IMGT reference directory. New functionalities
        were added through a complete rewrite in Java. IMGT/V-QUEST analyses batches
        of sequences (up to 50) in a single run. IMGT/V-QUEST describes the V-REGION
        mutations and identifies the hot spot positions in the closest germline V
        gene. IMGT/V-QUEST can detect insertions and deletions in the submitted sequences
        by reference to the IMGT unique numbering. IMGT/V-QUEST integrates IMGT/JunctionAnalysis
        for a detailed analysis of the V-J and V-D-J junctions, and IMGT/Automat for
        a full V-J- and V-D-J-REGION annotation. IMGT/V-QUEST displays, in 'Detailed
        view', the results and alignments for each submitted sequence individually
        and, in 'Synthesis view', the alignments of the sequences that, in a given
        run, express the same V gene and allele. The 'Advanced parameters' allow to
        modify default parameters used by IMGT/V-QUEST and IMGT/JunctionAnalysis according
        to the users' interest. IMGT/V-QUEST is freely available for academic research
        at http://imgt.cines.fr.

    metadata:
      abstract: "IMGT/V-QUEST, for 'V-QUEry and STandardization', is an integrated\
        \ software program which analyses the immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor\
        \ (TR) rearranged nucleotide sequences. The extraordinary diversity of the\
        \ IG and TR repertoires (1012 antibodies and 1012 TR per individual) results\
        \ from several mechanisms at the DNA level: the combinatorial diversity of\
        \ the variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes, the N-diversity and,\
        \ for IG, the somatic mutations. IMGT/V-QUEST identifies the V, D and J genes\
        \ and alleles by alignment with the germline IG and TR gene and allele sequences\
        \ of the IMGT reference directory. IMGT/V-QUEST delimits the structurally\
        \ important features, frameworks and complementarity-determining regions (the\
        \ last of these forming the antigen binding site), on the basis of the IMGT\
        \ unique numbering. The tool localizes the somatic mutations of the IG rearranged\
        \ sequences. IMGT/V-QUEST also dynamically displays a graphical two-dimensional\
        \ representation, or IMGT Collier de Peries, of the IG and TR variable regions.\
        \ Moreover, IMGT/V-QUEST can interact with IMGT/JunctionAnalysis for the detailed\
        \ description of the V-J and V-D-J junctions, and with IMGT/PhyloGene for\
        \ the construction of phylogenetic trees. IMGT/V-QUEST is currently available\
        \ for human and mouse, and partly for non-human primates, sheep, chondrichthyes\
        \ and teleostei. IMGT/V-QUEST is freely available at http://imgt.cines.fri.\
