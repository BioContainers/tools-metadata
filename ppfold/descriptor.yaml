      abstract: "Background: The prediction of the structure of large RNAs remains\
        \ a particular challenge in bioinformatics, due to the computational complexity\
        \ and low levels of accuracy of state-of-the-art algorithms. The pfold model\
        \ couples a stochastic context-free grammar to phylogenetic analysis for a\
        \ high accuracy in predictions, but the time complexity of the algorithm and\
        \ underflow errors have prevented its use for long alignments. Here we present\
        \ PPfold, a multithreaded version of pfold, which is capable of predicting\
        \ the structure of large RNA alignments accurately on practical timescales.Results:\
        \ We have distributed both the phylogenetic calculations and the inside-outside\
        \ algorithm in PPfold, resulting in a significant reduction of runtime on\
        \ multicore machines. We have addressed the floating-point underflow problems\
        \ of pfold by implementing an extended-exponent datatype, enabling PPfold\
        \ to be used for large-scale RNA structure predictions. We have also improved\
        \ the user interface and portability: alongside standalone executable and\
        \ Java source code of the program, PPfold is also available as a free plugin\
        \ to the CLC Workbenches. We have evaluated the accuracy of PPfold using BRaliBase\
        \ I tests, and demonstrated its practical use by predicting the secondary\
        \ structure of an alignment of 24 complete HIV-1 genomes in 65 minutes on\
        \ an 8-core machine and identifying several known structural elements in the\
        \ prediction.Conclusions: PPfold is the first parallelized comparative RNA\
        \ structure prediction algorithm to date. Based on the pfold model, PPfold\
        \ is capable of fast, high-quality predictions of large RNA secondary structures,\
        \ such as the genomes of RNA viruses or long genomic transcripts. The techniques\
        \ used in the parallelization of this algorithm may be of general applicability\
        \ to other bioinformatics algorithms. \xA9 2011 S\xFCk\xF6sd et al; licensee\

      abstract: "PPfold is a multi-threaded implementation of the Pfold algorithm\
        \ for RNA secondary structure prediction. Here we present a new version of\
        \ PPfold, which extends the evolutionary analysis with a flexible probabilistic\
        \ model for incorporating auxiliary data, such as data from structure probing\
        \ experiments. Our tests show that the accuracy of single-sequence secondary\
        \ structure prediction using experimental data in PPfold 3.0 is comparable\
        \ to RNAstructure. Furthermore, alignment structure prediction quality is\
        \ improved even further by the addition of experimental data. PPfold 3.0 therefore\
        \ has the potential of producing more accurate predictions than it was previously\
        \ possible. \xA9 The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All\
