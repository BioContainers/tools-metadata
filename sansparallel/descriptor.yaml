      abstract: "\xA9 2015 The Author(s).Proteins evolve by mutations and natural\
        \ selection. The network of sequence similarities is a rich source for mining\
        \ homologous relationships that inform on protein structure and function.\
        \ There are many servers available to browse the network of homology relationships\
        \ but one has to wait up to a minute for results. The SANSparallel webserver\
        \ provides protein sequence database searches with immediate response and\
        \ professional alignment visualization by third-party software. The output\
        \ is a list, pairwise alignment or stacked alignment of sequence-similar proteins\
        \ from Uniprot, UniRef90/50, Swissprot or Protein Data Bank. The stacked alignments\
        \ are viewed in Jalview or as sequence logos. The database search uses the\
        \ suffix array neighborhood search (SANS) method, which has been re-implemented\
        \ as a client-server, improved and parallelized. The method is extremely fast\
        \ and as sensitive as BLAST above 50% sequence identity. Benchmarks show that\
        \ the method is highly competitive compared to previously published fast database\
        \ search programs: UBLAST, DIAMOND, LAST, LAMBDA, RAPSEARCH2 and BLAT. The\
        \ web server can be accessed interactively or programmatically at http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.\
        \ fi/cgi-bin/sans/sans.cgi. It can be used to make protein functional annotation\
        \ pipelines more efficient, and it is useful in interactive exploration of\
        \ the detailed evidence supporting the annotation of particular proteins of\
        \ interest."
