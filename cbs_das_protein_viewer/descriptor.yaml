      abstract: "Using the Distributed Annotation System (DAS) we have created a protein\
        \ annotation resource available at our web page: http://www.cbs.dtu.dk, as\
        \ a part of the BioSapiens Network of Excellence EU FP6 project. The DAS protocol\
        \ allows us to gather layers of annotation data for a given sequence and thereby\
        \ gain an overview of the sequence's features. A user-friendly graphical client\
        \ has also been developed (http://www.cbs. dtu.dk/cgi-bin/das), which demonstrates\
        \ the possibility of integrating DAS annotation data from multiple sources\
        \ into a simple graphical view. The client displays protein feature annotations\
        \ from the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis as well as from the BioSapiens\
        \ reference UniProt server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/das-srv/uniprot/das) at the\
        \ European Bioinformatics Institute. Other DAS data sources for protein annotation\
        \ will be added as they become available. \xA9 2005 Oxford University Press."
