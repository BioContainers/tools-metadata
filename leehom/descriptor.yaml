      abstract: "\xA9 2014 The Author(s).The sequencing of libraries containing molecules\
        \ shorter than the read length, such as in ancient or forensic applications,\
        \ may result in the production of reads that include the adaptor, and in paired\
        \ reads that overlap one another. Challenges for the processing of such reads\
        \ are the accurate identification of the adaptor sequence and accurate reconstruction\
        \ of the original sequence most likely to have given rise to the observed\
        \ read(s). We introduce an algorithm that removes the adaptors and reconstructs\
        \ the original DNA sequences using a Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability\
        \ approach. Our algorithm is faster, and provides a more accurate reconstruction\
        \ of the original sequence for both simulated and ancient DNA data sets, than\
        \ other approaches. leeHom is released under the GPLv3 and is freely available\
