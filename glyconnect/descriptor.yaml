      abstract: "Copyright \xA9 2018 American Chemical Society. Knowledge of glycoproteins,\
        \ their site-specific glycosylation patterns, and the glycan structures that\
        \ they present to their recognition partners in health and disease is gradually\
        \ being built on using a range of experimental approaches. The data from these\
        \ analyses are increasingly being standardized and presented in various sources,\
        \ from supplemental tables in publications to localized servers in investigator\
        \ laboratories. Bioinformatics tools are now needed to collect these data\
        \ and enable the user to search, display, and connect glycomics and glycoproteomics\
        \ to other sources of related proteomics, genomics, and interactomics information.\
        \ We here introduce GlyConnect (https://glyconnect.expasy.org/), the central\
        \ platform of the Glycomics@ExPASy portal for glycoinformatics. GlyConnect\
        \ has been developed to gather, monitor, integrate, and visualize data in\
        \ a user-friendly way to facilitate the interpretation of collected glycoscience\
        \ data. GlyConnect is designed to accommodate and integrate multiple data\
        \ types as they are increasingly produced."
