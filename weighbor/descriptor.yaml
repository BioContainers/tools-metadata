      abstract: We introduce a distance-based phylogeny reconstruction method called
        'weighted neighbor joining,' or 'Weighbor' for short. As in neighbor joining,
        two taxa are joined in each iteration; however, the Weighbor criterion for
        choosing a pair of taxa to join takes into account that errors in distance
        estimates are exponentially larger for longer distances. The criterion embodies
        a likelihood function on the distances, which are modeled as correlated Gaussian
        random variables with different means and variances, computed under a probabilistic
        model for sequence evolution. The Weighbor criterion consists of two terms,
        an additivity term and a positivity term, that quantify the implications of
        joining the pair. The first term evaluates deviations from additivity of the
        implied external branches, while the second term evaluates confidence that
        the implied internal branch has a positive branch length. Compared with maximum-likelihood
        phylogeny reconstruction, Weighbor is much faster, while building trees that
        are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Weighbor appears to be relatively
        immune to the 'long branches attract' and 'long branch distracts' drawbacks
        observed with neighbor joining, BIONJ, and parsimony.
