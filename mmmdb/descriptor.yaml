description: 'Mouse Multiple Tissue Metabolome Database: metabolomic database containing
  a collection of metabolites measured from multiple tissues from single mice. The
  datases are collected using a single instrument and not integrated from literatures,
  which is useful for capturing the holistic overview of large metabolomic pathway.'

      abstract: "The Mouse Multiple Tissue Metabolome Database (MMMDB) provides comprehensive\
        \ and quantitative metabolomic information for multiple tissues from single\
        \ mice. Manually curated databases that integrate literature-based individual\
        \ metabolite information have been available so far. However, data sets on\
        \ the absolute concentration of a single metabolite integrated from multiple\
        \ resources are often difficult to be used when different metabolomic studies\
        \ are compared because the relative balance of the multiple metabolite concentrations\
        \ in the metabolic pathways as a snapshot of a dynamic system is more important\
        \ than the absolute concentration of a single metabolite. We developed MMMDB\
        \ by performing non-targeted analyses of cerebra, cerebella, thymus, spleen,\
        \ lung, liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, testis and plasma using capillary\
        \ electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry and detected 428 non-redundant\
        \ features from which 219 metabolites were successfully identified. Quantified\
        \ concentrations of the individual metabolites and the corresponding processed\
        \ raw data; for example, the electropherograms and mass spectra with their\
        \ annotations, such as isotope and fragment information, are stored in the\
        \ database. MMMDB is designed to normalize users' data, which can be submitted\
        \ online and used to visualize overlaid electropherograms. Thus, MMMDB allows\
        \ newly measured data to be compared with the other data in the database.\
        \ MMMDB is available at: http:// mmmdb.iab.keio.ac.jp. \xA9 The Author(s)\
