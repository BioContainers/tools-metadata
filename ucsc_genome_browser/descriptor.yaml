      abstract: "The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser website\
        \ (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) provides a large database of publicly available\
        \ sequence and annotation data along with an integrated tool set for examining\
        \ and comparing the genomes of organisms, aligning sequence to genomes, and\
        \ displaying and sharing users' own annotation data. As of September 2009,\
        \ genomic sequence and a basic set of annotation 'tracks' are provided for\
        \ 47 organisms, including 14 mammals, 10 non-mammal vertebrates, 3 invertebrate\
        \ deuterostomes, 13 insects, 6 worms and a yeast. New data highlights this\
        \ year include an updated human genome browser, a 44-species multiple sequence\
        \ alignment track, improved variation and phenotype tracks and 16 new genome-wide\
        \ ENCODE tracks. New features include drag-and-zoom navigation, a Wiki track\
        \ for user-added annotations, new custom track formats for large datasets\
        \ (bigBed and bigWig), a new multiple alignment output tool, links to variation\
        \ and protein structure tools, in silico PCR utility enhancements, and improved\
        \ track configuration tools. \xA9 The Author(s) 2009. Published by Oxford\

      abstract: "The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium is entering\
        \ its 5th year of productionlevel effort generating high-quality whole-genome\
        \ functional annotations of the human genome. The past year has brought the\
        \ ENCODE compendium of functional elements to critical mass, with a diverse\
        \ set of 27 biochemical assays now covering 200 distinct human cell types.\
        \ Within the mouse genome, which has been under study by ENCODE groups for\
        \ the past 2 years, 37 cell types have been assayed. Over 2000 individual\
        \ experiments have been completed and submitted to the Data Coordination Center\
        \ for public use. UCSC makes this data available on the quality-reviewed public\
        \ Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu) and on an early-access Preview Browser\
        \ (http://genomepreview. ucsc.edu). Visual browsing, data mining and download\
        \ of raw and processed data files are all supported. An ENCODE portal (http://\

        \ ENCODE data sets. \xA9 The Author(s) 2011."

      abstract: "The University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.\
        \ edu) offers online public access to a growing database of genomic sequence\
        \ and annotations for a wide variety of organisms. The Browser is an integrated\
        \ tool set for visualizing, comparing, analyzing and sharing both publicly\
        \ available and user-generated genomic data sets. In the past year, the local\
        \ database has been updated with four new species assemblies, and we anticipate\
        \ another four will be released by the end of 2011. Further, a large number\
        \ of annotation tracks have been either added, updated by contributors, or\
        \ remapped to the latest human reference genome. Among these are new phenotype\
        \ and disease annotations, UCSC genes, and a major dbSNP update, which required\
        \ new visualization methods. Growing beyond the local database, this year\
        \ we have introduced 'track data hubs', which allow the Genome Browser to\
        \ provide access to remotely located sets of annotations. This feature is\
        \ designed to significantly extend the number and variety of annotation tracks\
        \ that are publicly available for visualization and analysis from within our\
        \ site. We have also introduced several usability features including track\
        \ search and a context-sensitive menu of options available with a right-click\
        \ anywhere on the Browser's image. \xA9 The Author(s) 2011. Published by Oxford\
