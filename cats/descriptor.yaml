description: A unification of several software tools for sequence analysis developed
  at the IPK Gatersleben. The web BLAST server utilizes a homology search against
  the current cereal genome sequence resources (barley, rye and bread wheat). Kmasker
  plants is able to mask sequences originating from ten agronomically important plants
  based on mathematical defined repeats, furthermore, selection of sequences applicable
  for guideRNA construction for genome editing (CRISPR) or for fluorescence in situ
  hybridization is also possible. MISA web searches a nucleotide sequence for microsatellites
  and is able generate molecular markers or primer. Within BRIDGE the complete barley
  collection of the IPK genebank can be visually explored in an interactive manner
  through diversity, certain phenotyped traits, and based on sequence polymorphisms.
  The barley genome explorer (BARLEX) is a system to visually inspect the reference
  genome sequence of barley.
