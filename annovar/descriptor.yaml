      abstract: "High-throughput sequencing platforms are generating massive amounts\
        \ of genetic variation data for diverse genomes, but it remains a challenge\
        \ to pinpoint a small subset of functionally important variants. To fill these\
        \ unmet needs, we developed the ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide\
        \ variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional\
        \ consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting functional\
        \ importance scores, finding variants in conserved regions, or identifying\
        \ variants reported in the 1000 Genomes Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize\
        \ annotation databases from the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data\
        \ set conforming to Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also illustrate\
        \ a 'variants reduction' protocol on 4.7 million SNVs and indels from a human\
        \ genome, including two causal mutations for Miller syndrome, a rare recessive\
        \ disease. Through a stepwise procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely\
        \ to be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene.\
        \ Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires ~4 min to perform gene-based\
        \ annotation and ~15 min to perform variants reduction on 4.7 million variants,\
        \ making it practical to handle hundreds of human genomes in a day. ANNOVAR\
        \ is freely available at http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/. \xA9\
