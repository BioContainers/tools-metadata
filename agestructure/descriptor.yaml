      abstract: "Many long-lived plant and animal species have nondiscrete overlapping\
        \ generations. Although numerous models have been developed to predict the\
        \ effective sizes (Ne) of populations with overlapping generations, they are\
        \ extremely difficult to apply to natural populations because of the large\
        \ array of unknown and elusive life-table parameters involved. Unfortunately,\
        \ little work has been done to estimate the Ne of populations with overlapping\
        \ generations from marker data, in sharp contrast to the situation of populations\
        \ with discrete generations for which quite a few estimators are available.\
        \ In this study, we propose an estimator (EPA, estimator by parentage assignments)\
        \ of the current Ne of populations with overlapping generations, using the\
        \ sex, age, and multilocus genotype information of a single sample of individuals\
        \ taken at random from the population. Simulations show that EPA provides\
        \ unbiased and accurate estimates of Ne under realistic sampling and genotyping\
        \ effort. Additionally, it yields estimates of other interesting parameters\
        \ such as generation interval, the variances and covariances of lifetime family\
        \ size, effective number of breeders of each age class, and life-table variables.\
        \ Data from wild populations of baboons and hihi (stitchbird) were analyzed\
        \ by EPA to demonstrate the use of the estimator in practical sampling and\
        \ genotyping situations. \xA9 2010 The Author(s). Journal compilation \xA9\
