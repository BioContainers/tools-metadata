      abstract: Maximum-likelihood methods based on models of codon substitution have
        been widely used to infer positively selected amino acid sites that are responsible
        for adaptive changes. Nevertheless, in order to use such an approach, software
        applications are required to align protein and DNA sequences, infer a phylogenetic
        tree and run the maximum-likelihood models. Therefore, a significant effort
        is made in order to prepare input files for the different software applications
        and in the analysis of the output of every analysis. In this paper we present
        the ADOPS (Automatic Detection Of Positively Selected Sites) software. It
        was developed with the goal of providing an automatic and flexible tool for
        detecting positively selected sites given a set of unaligned nucleotide sequence
        data. An example of the usefulness of such a pipeline is given by showing,
        under different conditions, positively selected amino acid sites in a set
        of 54 Coffea putative S-RNase sequences. ADOPS software is freely available
        and can be downloaded from http://sing.ei.uvigo.es/ADOPS.
