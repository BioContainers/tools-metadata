      abstract: "DSAP is an automated multiple-task web service designed to provide\
        \ a total solution to analyzing deep-sequencing small RNA datasets generated\
        \ by next-generation sequencing technology. DSAP uses a tab-delimited file\
        \ as an input format, which holds the unique sequence reads (tags) and their\
        \ corresponding number of copies generated by the Solexa sequencing platform.\
        \ The input data will go through four analysis steps in DSAP: (i) cleanup:\
        \ removal of adaptors and poly-A/T/C/G/N nucleotides; (ii) clustering: grouping\
        \ of cleaned sequence tags into unique sequence clusters; (iii) non-coding\
        \ RNA (ncRNA) matching: sequence homology mapping against a transcribed sequence\
        \ library from the ncRNA database Rfam (http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/); and (iv)\
        \ known miRNA matching: detection of known miRNAs in miRBase (http://www.mirbase.org/)\
        \ based on sequence homology. The expression levels corresponding to matched\
        \ ncRNAs and miRNAs are summarized in multi-color clickable bar charts linked\
        \ to external databases. DSAP is also capable of displaying miRNA expression\
        \ levels from different jobs using a log2-scaled color matrix. Furthermore,\
        \ a cross-species comparative function is also provided to show the distribution\
        \ of identified miRNAs in different species as deposited in miRBase. DSAP\
        \ is available at http://dsap.cgu.edu.tw. \xA9 The Author(s) 2010. Published\
