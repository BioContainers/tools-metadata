      abstract: "Sequences subject to recombination and gene conversion defy phylogenetic\
        \ analysis by traditional methods since their evolutionary history cannot\
        \ be adequately summarized by a tree. This study investigates ways to describe\
        \ their evolutionary history and proposes a method giving a partial reconstruction\
        \ of this history. Multigene families, viruses, and alleles from within populations\
        \ experience recombinations/gene conversions, so the questions studied here\
        \ are relevant for a large body of data and the suggested solutions should\
        \ be very practical. The method employed was implemented in a program, RecPars,\
        \ written in C and was used to analyze nine retroviruses. \xA9 1993, Springer-Verlag.\
