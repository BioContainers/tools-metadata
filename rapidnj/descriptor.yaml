      abstract: "The neighbour-joining method reconstructs phylogenies by iteratively\
        \ joining pairs of nodes until a single node remains. The criterion for which\
        \ pair of nodes to merge is based on both the distance between the pair and\
        \ the average distance to the rest of the nodes. In this paper, we present\
        \ a new search strategy for the optimisation criteria used for selecting the\
        \ next pair to merge and we show empirically that the new search strategy\
        \ is superior to other state-of-the-art neighbour-joining implementations.\
