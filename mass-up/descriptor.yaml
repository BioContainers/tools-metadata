      abstract: "\xA9 2015 L\xF3pez-Fern\xE1ndez et al. Background: Mass spectrometry\
        \ is one of the most important techniques in the field of proteomics. MALDI-TOF\
        \ mass spectrometry has become popular during the last decade due to its high\
        \ speed and sensitivity for detecting proteins and peptides. MALDI-TOF-MS\
        \ can be also used in combination with Machine Learning techniques and statistical\
        \ methods for knowledge discovery. Although there are many software libraries\
        \ and tools that can be combined for these kind of analysis, there is still\
        \ a need for all-in-one solutions with graphical user-friendly interfaces\
        \ and avoiding the need of programming skills. Results: Mass-Up, an open software\
        \ multiplatform application for MALDI-TOF-MS knowledge discovery is herein\
        \ presented. Mass-Up software allows data preprocessing, as well as subsequent\
        \ analysis including (i) biomarker discovery, (ii) clustering, (iii) biclustering,\
        \ (iv) three-dimensional PCA visualization and (v) classification of large\
        \ sets of spectra data. Conclusions: Mass-Up brings knowledge discovery within\
        \ reach of MALDI-TOF-MS researchers. Mass-Up is distributed under license\
        \ GPLv3 and it is open and free to all users at http://sing.ei.uvigo.es/mass-up."
