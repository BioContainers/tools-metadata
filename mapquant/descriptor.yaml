      abstract: "Whole-cell protein quantification using MS has proven to be a challenging\
        \ task. Detection efficiency varies significantly from peptide to peptide,\
        \ molecular identities are not evident a priori, and peptides are dispersed\
        \ unevenly throughout the multidimensional data space. To overcome these challenges\
        \ we developed an open-source software package, MapQuant, to quantify comprehensively\
        \ organic species detected in large MS datasets. MapQuant treats an LC/MS\
        \ experiment as an image and utilizes standard image processing techniques\
        \ to perform noise filtering, watershed segmentation, peak finding, peak fitting,\
        \ peak clustering, charge-state determination and carbon-content estimation.\
        \ MapQuant reports abundance values that respond linearly with the amount\
        \ of sample analyzed on both low- and high-resolution instruments (over a\
        \ 1000-fold dynamic range). Background noise added to a sample, either as\
        \ a medium-complexity peptide mixture or as a high-complexity trypsinized\
        \ proteome, exerts negligible effects on the abundance values reported by\
        \ MapQuant and with coefficients of variance comparable to other methods.\
        \ Finally, MapQuant's ability to define accurate mass and retention time features\
        \ of isotopic clusters on a high-resolution mass spectrometer can increase\
        \ protein sequence coverage by assigning sequence identities to observed isotopic\
        \ clusters without corresponding MS/MS data. \xA9 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH\
