description: "The Pepstr server predicts the tertiary structure of small peptides\
  \ with sequence length varying between 7 to 25 residues. The prediction strategy\
  \ is based on the realization that \u03B2-turn is an important and consistent feature\
  \ of small peptides in addition to regular structures. Thus, the methods uses both\
  \ the regular secondary structure information predicted from PSIPRED and \u03B2\
  -turns information predicted from BetaTurns."

      abstract: "Among secondary structure elements, \u03B2-turns are ubiquitous and\
        \ major feature of bioactive peptides. We analyzed 77 biologically active\
        \ peptides with length varying from 9 to 20 residues. Out of 77 peptides,\
        \ 58 peptides were found to contain at least one \u03B2-turn. Further, at\
        \ the residue level, 34.9% of total peptide residues were found to be in \u03B2\
        -turns, higher than the number of helical (32.3%) and \u03B2-sheet residues\
        \ (6.9%). So, we utilized the predicted \u03B2-turns information to develop\
        \ an improved method for predicting the three-dimensional (3D) structure of\
        \ small peptides. In principle, we built four different structural models\
        \ for each peptide. The first 'model I' was built by assigning all the peptide\
        \ residues an extended conformation (\u03C6 = \u03A8 = 180\xB0). Second 'model\
        \ II' was built using the information of regular secondary structures (helices,\
        \ \u03B2-strands and coil) predicted from PSIPRED. In third 'model III', secondary\
        \ structure information including \u03B2-turn types predicted from BetaTurns\
        \ method was used. The fourth 'model IV' had main-chain \u03C6, \u03A8 angles\
        \ of model III and side chain angles assigned using standard Dunbrack backbone\
        \ dependent rotamer library. These models were further refined using AMBER\
        \ package and the resultant C\u03B1 rmsd values were calculated. It was found\
        \ that adding the \u03B2-turns to the regular secondary structures greatly\
        \ reduces the rmsd values both before and after the energy minimization. Hence,\
        \ the results indicate that regular and irregular secondary structures, particularly\
        \ \u03B2-turns information can provide valuable and vital information in the\
        \ tertiary structure prediction of small bioactive peptides. Based on the\
        \ above study, a web server PEPstr (http://www.imtech.res. in/raghava/pepstr/)\
        \ was developed for predicting the tertiary structure of small bioactive peptides.\
