description: This pipeline prepares the population genotypes ped/map files, runs them
  on SHAPEIT, optionally uses the results as input for IMPUTE2 using the 1000G phase
  III reference panel, and finally converts them to Chromopainter_v2 formats in order
  to perform with fineSTRUCTURE fs 2.0.7 two clusterings of donors and recipients
  respectively, and with Chromopainter_v2 a painting of the resulting recipient clusters
  out of the donor clusters.
