      abstract: "The recent expansion in our knowledge of protein-protein interactions\
        \ (PPIs) has allowed the annotation and prediction of hundreds of thousands\
        \ of interactions. However, the function of many of these interactions remains\
        \ elusive. The interactions of Eukaryotic Linear Motif (iELM) web server provides\
        \ a resource for predicting the function and positional interface for a subset\
        \ of interactions mediated by short linear motifs (SLiMs). The iELM prediction\
        \ algorithm is based on the annotated SLiM classes from the Eukaryotic Linear\
        \ Motif (ELM) resource and allows users to explore both annotated and user-generated\
        \ PPI networks for SLiM-mediated interactions. By incorporating the annotated\
        \ information from the ELM resource, iELM provides functional details of PPIs.\
        \ This can be used in proteomic analysis, for example, to infer whether an\
        \ interaction promotes complex formation or degradation. Furthermore, details\
        \ of the molecular interface of the SLiM-mediated interactions are also predicted.\
        \ This information is displayed in a fully searchable table, as well as graphically\
        \ with the modular architecture of the participating proteins extracted from\
        \ the UniProt and Phospho.ELM resources. A network figure is also presented\
        \ to aid the interpretation of results. The iELM server supports single protein\
        \ queries as well as large-scale proteomic submissions and is freely available\
        \ at http://i.elm.eu.org. \xA9 2012 The Author(s)."
