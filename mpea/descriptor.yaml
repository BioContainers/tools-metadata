description: MPEA is a rapid tool for functional analysis and biological interpretation
  of metabolic profiling data. In particular, MPEA is designed to be used with data
  generated by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS); one of the most prominent
  analytical methods for metabolic studies and able to quantify hundreds of small
  molecules from biological extracts in a single run.

      abstract: "Summary: We present metabolite pathway enrichment analysis (MPEA)\
        \ for the visualization and biological interpretation of metabolite data at\
        \ the system level. Our tool follows the concept of gene set enrichment analysis\
        \ (GSEA) and tests whether metabolites involved in some predefined pathway\
        \ occur towards the top (or bottom) of a ranked query compound list. In particular,\
        \ MPEA is designed to handle many-to-many relationships that may occur between\
        \ the query compounds and metabolite annotations. For a demonstration, we\
        \ analysed metabolite profiles of 14 twin pairs with differing body weights.\
        \ MPEA found significant pathways from data that had no significant individual\
        \ query compounds, its results were congruent with those discovered from transcriptomics\
        \ data and it detected more pathways than the competing metabolic pathway\
        \ method did. \xA9 The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.\
