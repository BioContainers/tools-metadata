      abstract: We describe a new method (T-Coffee) for multiple sequence alignment
        that provides a dramatic improvement in accuracy with a modest sacrifice in
        speed as compared to the most commonly used alternatives. The method is broadly
        based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids
        the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With
        T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the
        sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can
        be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then
        based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of
        the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived
        from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or
        structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by
        using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the
        library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined
        by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives
        that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test
        cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences
        in the tests. (C) 2000 Academic Press.
