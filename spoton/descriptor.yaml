description: 'Determination of Hot-Spots at protein-protein interfaces


  SpotOn is a robust algorithm developed to identify and classify the interfacial
  residues as Hot-Spots (HS) and Null-Spots (NS) with a final accuracy of 0.95 and
  a sensitivity of 0.95 on an independent test set.'

      abstract: "\xA9 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Understanding\
        \ protein-protein interactions is a key challenge in biochemistry. In this\
        \ work, we describe a more accurate methodology to predict Hot-Spots (HS)\
        \ in protein-protein interfaces from their native complex structure compared\
        \ to previous published Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Our model is trained\
        \ on a large number of complexes and on a significantly larger number of different\
        \ structural- and evolutionary sequence-based features. In particular, we\
        \ added interface size, type of interaction between residues at the interface\
        \ of the complex, number of different types of residues at the interface and\
        \ the Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), for a total of 79 features.\
        \ We used twenty-seven algorithms from a simple linear-based function to support-vector\
        \ machine models with different cost functions. The best model was achieved\
        \ by the use of the conditional inference random forest (c-forest) algorithm\
        \ with a dataset pre-processed by the normalization of features and with up-sampling\
        \ of the minor class. The method has an overall accuracy of 0.80, an F1-score\
        \ of 0.73, a sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.82 for the independent\
        \ test set."
