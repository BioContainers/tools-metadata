    abstract: A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search
      tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local
      similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results
      on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance
      of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates.
      The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number
      of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straight-forward DNA
      and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification
      searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA
      sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis,
      BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools
      of comparable sensitivity. © 1990, Academic Press Limited. All rights reserved.

    abstract: © The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf
      of Nucleic Acids Research. High-throughput data production technologies, particularly
      'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive
      changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced
      by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods,
      as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis
      in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform
      computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to
      address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational
      tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more
      accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment
      in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details
      automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report
      we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large
      scale.
