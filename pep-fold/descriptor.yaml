description: PEP-FOLD uses a hidden Markov model-derived structural alphabet for de
  novo modeling of 3D conformations of peptides between 9-25 amino acids in aqueous
  solution. Updates to PEP-FOLD allow for modeling of linear and disulphide bonded
  cyclic peptides with 9-36 amino acids using benchmarked peptides.

      abstract: "Rational peptide design and large-scale prediction of peptide structure\
        \ from sequence remain a challenge for chemical biologists. We present PEP-FOLD,\
        \ an online service, aimed at de novo modelling of 3D conformations for peptides\
        \ between 9 and 25 amino acids in aqueous solution. Using a hidden Markov\
        \ model-derived structural alphabet (SA) of 27 four-residue letters, PEP-FOLD\
        \ first predicts the SA letter profiles from the amino acid sequence and then\
        \ assembles the predicted fragments by a greedy procedure driven by a modified\
        \ version of the OPEP coarse-grained force field. Starting from an amino acid\
        \ sequence, PEP-FOLD performs series of 50 simulations and returns the most\
        \ representative conformations identified in terms of energy and population.\
        \ Using a benchmark of 25 peptides with 9-23 amino acids, and considering\
        \ the reproducibility of the runs, we find that, on average, PEP-FOLD locates\
        \ lowest energy conformations differing by 2.6 \xC5 C\u03B1 root mean square\
        \ deviation from the full NMR structures. PEP-FOLD can be accessed at http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/\
        \ PEP-FOLD."

      abstract: "In the context of the renewed interest of peptides as therapeutics,\
        \ it is important to have an on-line resource for 3D structure prediction\
        \ of peptides with well-defined structures in aqueous solution. We present\
        \ an updated version of PEP-FOLD allowing the treatment of both linear and\
        \ disulphide bonded cyclic peptides with 9-36 amino acids. The server makes\
        \ possible to define disulphide bonds and any residue-residue proximity under\
        \ the guidance of the biologists. Using a benchmark of 34 cyclic peptides\
        \ with one, two and three disulphide bonds, the best PEP-FOLD models deviate\
        \ by an average RMS of 2.75\xC5 from the full NMR structures. Using a benchmark\
        \ of 37 linear peptides, PEP-FOLD locates lowest-energy conformations deviating\
        \ by 3\xC5 RMS from the NMR rigid cores. The evolution of PEP-FOLD comes as\
        \ a new on-line service to supersede the previous server. The server is available\
        \ at: http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris- diderot.fr/PEP-FOLD. \xA9 2012 The Author(s)."
