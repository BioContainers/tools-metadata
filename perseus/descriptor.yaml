      abstract: Quantitative proteomics now provides abundance ratios for thousands
        of proteins upon perturbations. These need to be functionally interpreted
        and correlated to other types of quantitative genome-wide data such as the
        corresponding transcriptome changes. We describe a new method, 2D annotation
        enrichment, which compares quantitative data from any two 'omics' types in
        the context of categorical annotation of the proteins or genes. Suitable genome-wide
        categories are membership of proteins in biochemical pathways, their annotation
        with gene ontology terms, sub-cellular localization, presence of protein domains
        or membership in protein complexes. 2D annotation enrichment detects annotation
        terms whose members show consistent behavior in one or both of the data dimensions.
        This consistent behavior can be a correlation between the two data types,
        such as simultaneous up- or down-regulation in both data dimensions, or a
        lack thereof, such as regulation in one dimension but no change in the other.
        For the statistical formulation of the test we introduce a two-dimensional
        generalization of the nonparametric two-sample test. The false discovery rate
        is stringently controlled by correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. We
        also describe one-dimensional annotation enrichment, which can be applied
        to single omics data. The 1D and 2D annotation enrichment algorithms are freely
        available as part of the Perseus software.
