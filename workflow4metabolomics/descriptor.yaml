      abstract: "\xA9 2014 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press. The complex,\
        \ rapidly evolving field of computational metabolomics calls for collaborative\
        \ infrastructures where the large volume of new algorithms for data pre-processing,\
        \ statistical analysis and annotation can be readily integrated whatever the\
        \ language, evaluated on reference datasets and chained to build ad hoc workflows\
        \ for users. We have developed Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M), the first fully\
        \ open-source and collaborative online platform for computational metabolomics.\
        \ W4M is a virtual research environment built upon the Galaxy web-based platform\
        \ technology. It enables ergonomic integration, exchange and running of individual\
        \ modules and workflows. Alternatively, the whole W4M framework and computational\
        \ tools can be downloaded as a virtual machine for local installation."
