description: Tool for computing commonly-used structural and physicochemical features
  of proteins and peptides from amino acid sequence. New functions include computation
  of protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions, topological descriptors
  for peptide sequences and small molecule structures. New feature groups of descriptors
  have also been added.

      abstract: "Sequence-derived structural and physicochemical features have frequently\
        \ been used in the development of statistical learning models for prelicting\
        \ proteins and peptides of different structural, functional and interaction\
        \ profiles. PROFEAT (Protein Features) is a web server for computing commonly-used\
        \ structural and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino\
        \ acid sequence. It computes six feature groups composed of ten features that\
        \ include 51 descriptors and 1447 descriptor values. The computed features\
        \ include amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, normalized Moreau-Broto\
        \ autocorrelation, Moran autocorrelation, Geary autocorrelation, sequence-order-coupling\
        \ number, quasisequence-order descriptors and the composition, transition\
        \ and distribution of various structural and physicochemical properties. In\
        \ addition, it can also compute previous autocorrelations descriptors based\
        \ on user-defined properties. Our computational algorithms were extensively\
        \ tested and the computed protein features have been used in a number of published\
        \ works for predicting proteins of functional classes, protein-protein interactions\
        \ and MHC-binding peptides. PROFEAT is accessible at http://jing.cz3.nus.edu.sg/cgi-bin/prof/prof.cgi.\
