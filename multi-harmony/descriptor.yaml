      abstract: "Many protein families contain sub-families with functional specialization,\
        \ such as binding different ligands or being involved in different protein-\
        \ protein interactions. A small number of amino acids generally determine\
        \ functional specificity. The identification of these residues can aid the\
        \ understanding of protein function and help finding targets for experimental\
        \ analysis. Here, we present multi-Harmony, an interactive web sever for detect-ing\
        \ sub-type-specific sites in proteins starting from a multiple sequence alignment.\
        \ Combining our Sequence Harmony (SH) and multi-Relief (mR) methods in one\
        \ web server allows simultaneous analysis and comparison of specificity residues;\
        \ fur-thermore, both methods have been significantly improved and extended.\
        \ SH has been extended to cope with more than two sub-groups. mR has been\
        \ changed from a sampling implementation to a de-terministic one, making it\
        \ more consistent and user friendly. For both methods Z-scores are reported.\
        \ The multi-Harmony web server produces a dynamic output page, which includes\
        \ interactive connections to the Jalview and Jmol applets, thereby allowing\
        \ interactive analysis of the results. Multi-Harmony is available at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/shmrwww.\
