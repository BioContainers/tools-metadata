description: A freely accessible, public archive of reports of relationships among
  medically important variants and phenotypes hosted by the NCBI. It integrates and
  cross-references data from multiple databases at NCBI. In addition to dbSNP and
  dbVar, it depends on MedGen to represent phenotype, Gene to represent genes, and
  on human RefSeqs to represent the location of sequence variation. Each record represents
  the submitter, the variation and the phenotype.

      abstract: "ClinVar (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) provides a freely\
        \ available archive of reports of relationships among medically important\
        \ variants and phenotypes. ClinVar accessions submissions reporting human\
        \ variation, interpretations of the relationship of that variation to human\
        \ health and the evidence supporting each interpretation. The database is\
        \ tightly coupled with dbSNP and dbVar, which maintain information about the\
        \ location of variation on human assemblies. ClinVar is also based on the\
        \ phenotypic descriptions maintained in MedGen (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen).\
        \ Each ClinVar record represents the submitter, the variation and the phenotype,\
        \ i.e. the unit that is assigned an accession of the format SCV000000000.0.\
        \ The submitter can update the submission at any time, in which case a new\
        \ version is assigned. To facilitate evaluation of the medical importance\
        \ of each variant, ClinVar aggregates submissions with the same variation/phenotype\
        \ combination, adds value from other NCBI databases, assigns a distinct accession\
        \ of the format RCV000000000.0 and reports if there are conflicting clinical\
        \ interpretations. Data in ClinVar are available in multiple formats, including\
        \ html, download as XML, VCF or tab-delimited subsets. Data from ClinVar are\
        \ provided as annotation tracks on genomic RefSeqs and are used in tools such\
        \ as Variation Reporter (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/tools/reporter),\
        \ which reports what is known about variation based on user-supplied locations.\
