      abstract: "MicroScope is an integrated platform dedicated to both the methodical\
        \ updating of microbial genome annotation and to comparative analysis. The\
        \ resource provides data from completed and ongoing genome projects (automatic\
        \ and expert annotations), together with data sources from post-genomic experiments\
        \ (i.e. transcriptomics, mutant collections) allowing users to perfect and\
        \ improve the understanding of gene functions. MicroScope (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/\
        \ agc/microscope) combines tools and graphical interfaces to analyse genomes\
        \ and to perform the manual curation of gene annotations in a comparative\
        \ context. Since its first publication in January 2006, the system (previously\
        \ named MaGe for Magnifying Genomes) has been continuously extended both in\
        \ terms of data content and analysis tools. The last update of MicroScope\
        \ was published in 2009 in the Database journal. Today, the resource contains\
        \ data for >1600 microbial genomes, of which 300 are manually curated and\
        \ maintained by biologists (1200 personal accounts today). Expert annotations\
        \ are continuously gathered in the MicroScope database (\u223C50000 a year),\
        \ contributing to the improvement of the quality of microbial genomes annotations.\
        \ Improved data browsing and searching tools have been added, original tools\
        \ useful in the context of expert annotation have been developed and integrated\
        \ and the website has been significantly redesigned to be more user-friendly.\
        \ Furthermore, in the context of the European project Microme (Framework Program\
        \ 7 Collaborative Project), MicroScope is becoming a resource providing for\
        \ the curation and analysis of both genomic and metabolic data. An increasing\
        \ number of projects are related to the study of environmental bacterial (meta)genomes\
        \ that are able to metabolize a large variety of chemical compounds that may\
        \ be of high industrial interest. \xA9 The Author(s) 2012."

      abstract: "\xA9 The Author(s) 2009. The initial outcome of genome sequencing\
        \ is the creation of long text strings written in a four letter alphabet.\
        \ The role of in silico sequence analysis is to assist biologists in the act\
        \ of associating biological knowledge with these sequences, allowing investigators\
        \ to make inferences and predictions that can be tested experimentally. A\
        \ wide variety of software is available to the scientific community, and can\
        \ be used to identify genomic objects, before predicting their biological\
        \ functions. However, only a limited number of biologically interesting features\
        \ can be revealed from an isolated sequence. Comparative genomics tools, on\
        \ the other hand, by bringing together the information contained in numerous\
        \ genomes simultaneously, allow annotators to make inferences based on the\
        \ idea that evolution and natural selection are central to the definition\
        \ of all biological processes. We have developed the MicroScope platform in\
        \ order to offer a web-based framework for the systematic and efficient revision\
        \ of microbial genome annotation and comparative analysis (http:// www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope).\
        \ Starting with the description of the flow chart of the annotation processes\
        \ implemented in the MicroScope pipeline, and the development of traditional\
        \ and novel microbial annotation and comparative analysis tools, this article\
        \ emphasizes the essential role of expert annotation as a complement of automatic\
        \ annotation. Several examples illustrate the use of implemented tools for\
        \ the review and curation of annotations of both new and publicly available\
        \ microbial genomes within MicroScope's rich integrated genome framework.\
        \ The platform is used as a viewer in order to browse updated annotation information\
        \ of available microbial genomes (more than 440 organisms to date), and in\
        \ the context of new annotation projects (117 bacterial genomes). The human\
        \ expertise gathered in the MicroScope database (about 280,000 independent\
        \ annotations) contributes to improve the quality of microbial genome annotation,\
        \ especially for genomes initially analyzed by automatic procedures alone."

      abstract: "Magnifying Genomes (MaGe) is a microbial genome annotation system\
        \ based on a relational database containing information on bacterial genomes,\
        \ as well as a web interface to achieve genome annotation projects. Our system\
        \ allows one to initiate the annotation of a genome at the early stage of\
        \ the finishing phase. MaGe's main features are (i) integration of annotation\
        \ data from bacterial genomes enhanced by a gene coding re-annotation process\
        \ using accurate gene models, (ii) integration of results obtained with a\
        \ wide range of bioinformatics methods, among which exploration of gene context\
        \ by searching for conserved synteny and reconstruction of metabolic pathways,\
        \ (iii) an advanced web interface allowing multiple users to refine the automatic\
        \ assignment of gene product functions. MaGe is also linked to numerous well-known\
        \ biological databases and systems. Our system has been thoroughly tested\
        \ during the annotation of complete bacterial genomes (Acinetobacter baylyi\
        \ ADP1,Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, Frankia alni) and is currently used\
        \ in the context of several new microbial genome annotation projects. In addition,\
        \ MaGe allows for annotation curation and exploration of already published\
        \ genomes from various genera (e.g. Yersinia, Bacillus and Neisseria). MaGe\

      abstract: "\xA9 2016 The Author(s).The annotation of genomes from NGS platforms\
        \ needs to be automated and fully integrated. However, maintaining consistency\
        \ and accuracy in genome annotation is a challenging problem because millions\
        \ of protein database entries are not assigned reliable functions. This shortcoming\
        \ limits the knowledge that can be extracted from genomes and metabolic models.\
        \ Launched in 2005, the MicroScope platform (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope)\
        \ is an integrative resource that supports systematic and efficient revision\
        \ of microbial genome annotation, data management and comparative analysis.\
        \ Effective comparative analysis requires a consistent and complete view of\
        \ biological data, and therefore, support for reviewing the quality of functional\
        \ annotation is critical. MicroScope allows users to analyze microbial (meta)genomes\
        \ together with post-genomic experiment results if any (i.e. transcriptomics,\
        \ resequencing of evolved strains, mutant collections, phenotype data). It\
        \ combines tools and graphical interfaces to analyze genomes and to perform\
        \ the expert curation of gene functions in a comparative context. Starting\
        \ with a short overview of the MicroScope system, this paper focuses on some\
        \ major improvements of the Web interface, mainly for the submission of genomic\
        \ data and on original tools and pipelines that have been developed and integrated\
        \ in the platform: computation of pan-genomes and prediction of biosynthetic\
        \ gene clusters. Today the resource contains data for more than 6000 microbial\
        \ genomes, and among the 2700 personal accounts (65% of which are now from\
        \ foreign countries), 14% of the users are performing expert annotations,\
