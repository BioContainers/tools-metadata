description: The Automatic Image Processing for Microarrays tool is designed for uncalibrated
  microarray gridding and quantitative image analysis. Uncalibrated microarray image
  analysis supports integration of expression data from different sources and can
  improve reproducibility.

      abstract: This paper describes image processing methods for automatic spotted
        microarray image analysis. Automatic gridding is important to achieve constant
        data quality and is, therefore, especially interesting for large-scale experiments
        as well as for integration of microarray expression data from different sources.
        We propose a Markov random field (MRF) based approach to high-level grid segmentation,
        which is robust to common problems encountered with array images and does
        not require calibration. We also propose an active contour method for single-spot
        segmentation. Active contour models describe objects in images by properties
        of their boundaries. Both MRFs and active contour models have been used in
        various other computer vision applications. The traditional active contour
        model must be generalized for successful application to microarray spot segmentation.
        Our active contour model is employed for spot detection in the MRF score functions
        as well as for spot signal segmentation in quantitative array image analysis.
        An evaluation using several image series from different sources shows the
        robustness of our methods.
