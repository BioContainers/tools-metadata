      abstract: We have developed three computer programs for comparisons of protein
        and DNA sequences. They can be used to search sequence data bases, evaluate
        similarity scores, and identify periodic structures based on local sequence
        similarity. The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP
        program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and
        can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating
        the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in
        the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple
        regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences.
        The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores
        using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA
        program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences
        with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and
        a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as
        a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs
        have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based
        on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.
