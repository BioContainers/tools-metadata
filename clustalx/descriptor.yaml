description: Version of the Clustal W multiple sequence alignment program with a graphical
  interface. The display colours allow conserved features to be highlighted for easy
  viewing in the alignment. It is available for several platforms, including Windows,
  Macintosh PowerMac, Linux and Solaris.

      abstract: 'CLUSTAL X is a new windows interface for the widely-used progressive
        multiple sequence alignment program CLUSTAL W. The new system is easy to use,
        providing an integrated system for performing multiple sequence and profile
        alignments and analysing the results. CLUSTAL X displays the sequence alignment
        in a window on the screen. A versatile sequence colouring scheme allows the
        user to highlight conserved features in the alignment. Pull-down menus provide
        all the options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment.
        New features include: the ability to cut-and-paste sequences to change the
        order of the alignment, selection of a subset of the sequences to be realigned,
        and selection of a sub-range of the alignment to be realigned and inserted
        back into the original alignment. Alignment quality analysis can be performed
        and low-scoring segments or exceptional residues can be highlighted. Quality
        analysis and realignment of selected residue ranges provide the user with
        a powerful tool to improve and refine difficult alignments and to trap errors
        in input sequences. CLUSTAL X has been compiled on SUN Solaris, IRIX5.3 on
        Silicon Graphics, Digital UNIX on DECstations, Microsoft Windows (32 bit)
        for PCs, Linux ELF for x86 PCs, and Macintosh PowerMac.'

      abstract: The Clustal series of programs are widely used in molecular biology
        for the multiple alignment of both nucleic acid and protein sequences and
        for preparing phylogenetic trees. The popularity of the programs depends on
        a number of factors, including not only the accuracy of the results, but also
        the robustness, portability and user-friendliness of the programs. New features
        include NEXUS and FASTA format output, printing range numbers and faster tree
        calculation. Although, Clustal was originally developed to run on a local
        computer, numerous Web servers have been set up, notably at the EBI (European
        Bioinformatics Institute) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/).
