      abstract: "Analytical advantages of using multiple enzymes for sample digestion\
        \ (MED), primarily an increase of sequence coverage, have been reported in\
        \ several studies. However, this approach is only rarely used, mainly because\
        \ it requires additional sample and mass spectrometric measurement time. We\
        \ have previously described Filter Aided Sample Preparation (FASP), a type\
        \ of proteomic reactor, in which samples dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate\
        \ (SDS) are digested in an ultrafiltration unit. In FASP, such as in any other\
        \ preparation protocol, a portion of sample remains after digestion and peptide\
        \ elution. Making use of this fact, we here develop a protocol enabling consecutive\
        \ digestion of the sample with two or three enzymes. By use of the FASP method,\
        \ peptides are liberated after each digestion step and remaining material\
        \ is subsequently cleaved with the next proteinase. We observed excellent\
        \ performance of the ultrafiltration devices in this mode, allowing efficient\
        \ separation of orthogonal populations of peptides, resulting in an increase\
        \ in the numbers of identified peptides and proteins. At the low microgram\
        \ level, we found that the consecutive use of endoproteinases LysC and trypsin\
        \ enabled identification of up to 40% more proteins and phosphorylation sites\
        \ in comparison to the commonly used one-step tryptic digestion. MED-FASP\
        \ offers efficient exploration of previously unused sample material, increasing\
        \ depth of proteomic analyses and sequence coverage. \xA9 2012 American Chemical\
