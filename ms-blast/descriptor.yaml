      abstract: MALDI-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was applied to identify
        proteins from organisms whose genomes are still unknown. The identification
        was carried out by successively searching a sequence database - first with
        a peptide mass fingerprint, then with a packet of noninterpreted MS/MS spectra,
        and finally with peptide sequences obtained by automated interpretation of
        the MS/MS spectra. A "MS BLAST" homology searching protocol was developed
        to overcome specific limitations imposed by mass spectrometric data, such
        as the limited accuracy of de novo sequence predictions. This approach was
        tested in a small-scale proteomic project involving the identification of
        15 bands of gel-separated proteins from the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris,
        whose genome has not yet been sequenced and which is only distantly related
        to other fungi.
