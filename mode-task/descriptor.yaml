      abstract: 'Summary: MODE-TASK, a novel and versatile software suite, comprises
        Principal Component Analysis, Multidimensional Scaling, and t-Distributed
        Stochastic Neighbor Embedding techniques using Molecular Dynamics trajectories.
        MODE-TASK also includes a Normal Mode Analysis tool based on Anisotropic Network
        Model so as to provide a variety of ways to analyse and compare large-scale
        motions of protein complexes for which long MD simulations are prohibitive.
        Beside the command line function, a GUI has been developed as a PyMOL plugin.
        Availability and implementation: MODE-TASK is open source, and available for
        download from https://github.com/RUBi-ZA/MODE-TASK. It is implemented in Python
        and C++. It is compatible with Python 2.x and Python 3.x and can be installed
        by Conda. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics
        online.'
