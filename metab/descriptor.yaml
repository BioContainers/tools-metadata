description: R package for high-throughput processing of metabolomics data analysed
  by the Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) In
  addition, it performs statistical hypothesis test (t-test) and analysis of variance
  (ANOVA). Doing so, it considerably speeds up the data mining process in metabolomics
  and produces better quality results.

    abstract: 'Motivation: The Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification
      System (AMDIS) is freeware extensively applied in metabolomics. However, datasets
      processed by AMDIS require extensive data correction, filtering and reshaping
      to create reliable datasets for further downstream analysis. Performed manually,
      these processes are laborious and extremely time consuming. Furthermore, manual
      corrections increase the chance of human error and can introduce additional
      technical variability to the data. Thus, an automated pipeline for curating
      GC-MS data is urgently needed.Results: We present the Metab R package designed
      to automate the pipeline for analysis of metabolomics GC-MS datasets processed
      by AMDIS. Â© The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights
