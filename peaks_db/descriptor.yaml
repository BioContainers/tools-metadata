      abstract: "Many software tools have been developed for the automated identification\
        \ of peptides from tandem mass spectra. The accuracy and sensitivity of the\
        \ identification software via database search are critical for successful\
        \ proteomics experiments. A new database search tool, PEAKS DB, has been developed\
        \ by incorporating the de novo sequencing results into the database search.\
        \ PEAKS DB achieves significantly improved accuracy and sensitivity over two\
        \ other commonly used software packages. Additionally, a new result validation\
        \ method, decoy fusion, has been introduced to solve the issue of overconfidence\
        \ that exists in the conventional target decoy method for certain types of\
        \ peptide identification software. \xA9 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry\
        \ and Molecular Biology, Inc."
