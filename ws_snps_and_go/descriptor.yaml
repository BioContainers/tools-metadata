    abstract: 'Background: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are an important
      source of human genome variability. Non-synonymous SNPs occurring in coding
      regions result in single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) that may affect protein
      function and lead to pathology. Several methods attempt to estimate the impact
      of SAPs using different sources of information. Although sequence-based predictors
      have shown good performance, the quality of these predictions can be further
      improved by introducing new features derived from three-dimensional protein
      structures.Results: In this paper, we present a structure-based machine learning
      approach for predicting disease-related SAPs. We have trained a Support Vector
      Machine (SVM) on a set of 3,342 disease-related mutations and 1,644 neutral
      polymorphisms from 784 protein chains. We use SVM input features derived from
      the protein''s sequence, structure, and function. After dataset balancing, the
      structure-based method (SVM-3D) reaches an overall accuracy of 85%, a correlation
      coefficient of 0.70, and an area under the receiving operating characteristic
      curve (AUC) of 0.92. When compared with a similar sequence-based predictor,
      SVM-3D results in an increase of the overall accuracy and AUC by 3%, and correlation
      coefficient by 0.06. The robustness of this improvement has been tested on different
      datasets and in all the cases SVM-3D performs better than previously developed
      methods even when compared with PolyPhen2, which explicitly considers in input
      protein structure information.Conclusion: This work demonstrates that structural
      information can increase the accuracy of disease-related SAPs identification.
      Our results also quantify the magnitude of improvement on a large dataset. This
      improvement is in agreement with previously observed results, where structure
      information enhanced the prediction of protein stability changes upon mutation.
      Although the structural information contained in the Protein Data Bank is limiting
      the application and the performance of our structure-based method, we expect
      that SVM-3D will result in higher accuracy when more structural date become
      available. Â© 2011 Capriotti; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.'
