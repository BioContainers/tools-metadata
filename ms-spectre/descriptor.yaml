      abstract: "An acidic prolyl endoprotease from Aspergillus niger was isolated\
        \ from the commercial product Brewers Clarex\u2122 to evaluate its possible\
        \ application in proteomics. The chromatographic purification yielded a single\
        \ protein band in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\
        \ providing an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa and a broad peak (m/z 58\
        \ 061) in linear matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight\
        \ (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) indicating the glycoprotein nature of the enzyme.\
        \ Indeed, a colorimetric assessment with phenol and sulfuric acid showed the\
        \ presence of neutral sugars (9% of weight). The subsequent treatment with\
        \ N-glycosidase F released a variety of high-mannose type N-glycans,which\
        \ were successfully detected using MALDI-TOF MS. MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem MS analysis\
        \ of glycopeptides from a tryptic digest of prolyl endoprotease unraveled\
        \ the identity of the N-glycosylation site in the primary structure. The data\
        \ obtained also show that the enzyme is present in its processed form, i.e.\
        \ without putative signal and propeptide parts. Spectrophotometric measurements\
        \ demonstrated optimal activity at pH 4.0-4.5 and also high thermostability\
        \ for the cleavage at the C-terminal part of proline residues. In-solution\
        \ digestion of standard proteins (12-200 kDa) allowed to evaluate the cleavage\
        \ specificity. The enzyme acts upon proline and alanine residues, but there\
        \ is an additional minor cleavage at some other residues like Gly, Leu, Arg,\
        \ Ser and Tyr. The digestion of a honeybee peptide comprising six proline\
        \ residues (apidaecin 1A) led to the detection of specific peptides terminated\
        \ by proline as it was confirmed by MALDI postsource decay analysis. Copyright\
