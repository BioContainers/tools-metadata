description: Network optimization approach for revealing signaling and regulatory
  networks linking genetic and transcriptomic screening data. Users upload weighted
  lists of proteins and genes. 2.0 version enhances the functionality by offering
  a human interactome of proteins, genes and micro-RNAs, and better output visualization.

      abstract: 'Genome sequencing and transcriptomic profiling are two widely used
        approaches for the identification of human disease pathways. However, each
        approach typically provides a limited view of disease pathways: Genome sequencing
        can identify disease-related mutations but rarely reveals their mode-of-action,
        while transcriptomic assays do not reveal the series of events that lead to
        the transcriptomic change. ResponseNet is an integrative network-optimization
        approach that we developed to fill these gaps by highlighting major signaling
        and regulatory molecular interaction paths that connect disease-related mutations
        and genes. The ResponseNet web-server provides a user-friendly interface to
        ResponseNet. Specifically, users can upload weighted lists of proteins and
        genes and obtain a sparse, weighted, molecular interaction subnetwork connecting
        them, that is biased toward regulatory and signaling pathways. ResponseNet2.0
        enhances the functionality of the ResponseNet web-server in two important
        ways. First, it supports analysis of human data by offering a human interactome
        composed of proteins, genes and micro-RNAs. Second, it offers a new informative
        view of the output, including a randomization analysis, to help users assess
        the biological relevance of the output subnetwork. ResponseNet2.0 is available
        at http://netbio.bgu.ac.il/respnet .'

      abstract: "Cellular response to stimuli is typically complex and involves both\
        \ regulatory and metabolic processes. Large-scale experimental efforts to\
        \ identify components of these processes often comprise of genetic screening\
        \ and transcriptomic profiling assays. We previously established that in yeast\
        \ genetic screens tend to identify response regulators, while transcriptomic\
        \ profiling assays tend to identify components of metabolic processes. ResponseNet\
        \ is a network-optimization approach that integrates the results from these\
        \ assays with data of known molecular interactions. Specifically, ResponseNet\
        \ identifies a high-probability sub-network, composed of signaling and regulatory\
        \ molecular interaction paths, through which putative response regulators\
        \ may lead to the measured transcriptomic changes. Computationally, this is\
        \ achieved by formulating a minimum-cost flow optimization problem and solving\
        \ it efficiently using linear programming tools. The ResponseNet web server\
        \ offers a simple interface for applying ResponseNet. Users can upload weighted\
        \ lists of proteins and genes and obtain a sparse, weighted, molecular interaction\
        \ sub-network connecting their data. The predicted sub-network and its gene\
        \ ontology enrichment analysis are presented graphically or as text. Consequently,\
        \ the ResponseNet web server enables researchers that were previously limited\
        \ to separate analysis of their distinct, large-scale experiments, to meaningfully\
        \ integrate their data and substantially expand their understanding of the\
        \ underlying cellular response. ResponseNet is available at http://bioinfo.bgu.ac.\
