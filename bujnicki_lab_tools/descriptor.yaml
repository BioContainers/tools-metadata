      abstract: "\xA9 2016 The Author(s) The diverse functional cellular roles played\
        \ by ribonucleic acids (RNA) have emphasized the need to develop rapid and\
        \ accurate methodologies to elucidate the relationship between the structure\
        \ and function of RNA. Structural biology tools such as X-ray crystallography\
        \ and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance are highly useful methods to obtain atomic-level\
        \ resolution models of macromolecules. However, both methods have sample,\
        \ time, and technical limitations that prevent their application to a number\
        \ of macromolecules of interest. An emerging alternative to high-resolution\
        \ structural techniques is to employ a hybrid approach that combines low-resolution\
        \ shape information about macromolecules and their complexes from experimental\
        \ hydrodynamic (e.g. analytical ultracentrifugation) and solution scattering\
        \ measurements (e.g., solution X-ray or neutron scattering), with computational\
        \ modeling to obtain atomic-level models. While promising, scattering methods\
        \ rely on aggregation-free, monodispersed preparations and therefore the careful\
        \ development of a quality control pipeline is fundamental to an unbiased\
        \ and reliable structural determination. This review article describes hydrodynamic\
        \ techniques that are highly valuable for homogeneity studies, scattering\
        \ techniques useful to study the low-resolution shape, and strategies for\
        \ computational modeling to obtain high-resolution 3D structural models of\
        \ RNAs, proteins, and RNA-protein complexes."
