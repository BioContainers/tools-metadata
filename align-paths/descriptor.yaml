      abstract: "\xA9 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.In the wake of gene-oriented\
        \ data analysis in large-scale bioinformatics studies, focus in research is\
        \ currently shifting towards the analysis of the functional association of\
        \ genes, namely the metabolic pathways in which genes participate. The goal\
        \ of this paper is to attempt to identify the core genes in a specific pathway,\
        \ based on a user-defined selection of genomes. To this end, a novel algorithm\
        \ has been developed that uses data from the KEGG database, and through the\
        \ application of the MCL clustering algorithm, identifies clusters that correspond\
        \ to different layers of genes, either on a phylogenetic or a functional level.\
        \ The algorithm's complexity, evaluated experimentally, is presented and the\
        \ results on three characteristic case studies are discussed."
