      abstract: "\xA9 The Author(s) 2015. Recently, data on 'random' autosomal monoallelic\
        \ expression has become available for the entire genome in multiple human\
        \ and mouse tissues and cell types, creating a need for better access and\
        \ dissemination. The database of autosomal monoallelic expression (dbMAE;\
        \ https://mae.hms.harvard.edu) incorporates data from multiple recent reports\
        \ of genome-wide analyses. These include transcriptome-wide analyses of allelic\
        \ imbalance in clonal cell populations based on sequence polymorphisms, as\
        \ well as indirect identification, based on a specific chromatin signature\
        \ present in MAE gene bodies. Currently, dbMAE contains transcriptomewide\
        \ chromatin identification calls for 8 human and 21 mouse tissues, and describes\
        \ over 16 000 murine and \u223C700 human cases of directly measured biased\
        \ expression, compiled from allele-specific RNA-seq and genotyping array data.\
        \ All data are manually curated. To ensure cross-publication uniformity, we\
        \ performed re-analysis of transcriptome-wide RNA-seq data using the same\
        \ pipeline. Data are accessed through an interface that allows for basic and\
        \ advanced searches; all source references, including raw data, are clearly\
        \ described and hyperlinked. This ensures the utility of the resource as an\
        \ initial screening tool for those interested in investigating the role of\
        \ monoallelic expression in their specific genes and tissues of interest."
