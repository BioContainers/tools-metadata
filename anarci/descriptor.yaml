      abstract: "\xA9 2015 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.\
        \ Motivation: Antibody amino-acid sequences can be numbered to identify equivalent\
        \ positions. Such annotations are valuable for antibody sequence comparison,\
        \ protein structure modelling and engineering. Multiple different numbering\
        \ schemes exist, they vary in the nomenclature they use to annotate residue\
        \ positions, their definitions of position equivalence and their popularity\
        \ within different scientific disciplines. However, currently no publicly\
        \ available software exists that can apply all the most widely used schemes\
        \ or for which an executable can be obtained under an open license. Results:\
        \ ANARCI is a tool to classify and number antibody and T-cell receptor amino-acid\
        \ variable domain sequences. It can annotate sequences with the five most\
        \ popular numbering schemes: Kabat, Chothia, Enhanced Chothia, IMGT and AHo.\
        \ Availability and implementation: ANARCI is available for download under\
        \ GPLv3 license at opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/anarci. A web-interface to\
        \ the program is available at the same address. Contact:"
