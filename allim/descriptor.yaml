      abstract: "Estimating differences in gene expression among alleles is of high\
        \ interest for many areas in biology and medicine. Here, we present a user-friendly\
        \ software tool, Allim, to estimate allele-specific gene expression. Because\
        \ mapping bias is a major problem for reliable estimates of allele-specific\
        \ gene expression using RNA-seq, Allim combines two different strategies to\
        \ account for the mapping biases. In order to reduce the mapping bias, Allim\
        \ first generates a polymorphism-aware reference genome that accounts for\
        \ the sequence variation between the alleles. Then, a sequence-specific simulation\
        \ tool estimates the residual mapping bias. Statistical tests for allelic\
        \ imbalance are provided that can be used with the bias corrected RNA-seq\
        \ data. \xA9 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
