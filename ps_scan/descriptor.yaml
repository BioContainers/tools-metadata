description: "ps_scan (ScanProsite tool) is a perl program used to scan one or several\
  \ patterns, rules and/or profiles from PROSITE against one or several protein sequnces\
  \ in Swiss-Prot or FASTA format. It requires two compiled external programs from\
  \ the PFTOOLS package : \u201Cpfscan\u201D used to scan a sequence against a profile\
  \ library and \u201Cpsa2msa\u201D which is necessary for the \u201C-o msa\u201D\
  \ output format only."

    metadata:
      abstract: Many different software tools are available publicly to scan the PROSITE
        database of protein families. However, none of them, to our knowledge, wholly
        implements the PROSITE syntax, or satisfies all the rules for scanning a pattern
        against a sequence. We hereby propose a strict definition of how a PROSITE
        pattern is to be scanned against a sequence, and provide a reference implementation
        of a tool to scan PROSITE patterns, rules and profiles against protein sequences.
