      abstract: "Next generation sequencing has now enabled a cost-effective enumeration\
        \ of the full mutational complement of a tumor genome-in particular single\
        \ nucleotide variants (SNVs). Most current computational and statistical models\
        \ for analyzing next generation sequencing data, however, do not account for\
        \ cancer-specific biological properties, including somatic segmental copy\
        \ number alterations (CNAs)-which require special treatment of the data. Here\
        \ we present CoNAn-SNV (Copy Number Annotated SNV): a novel algorithm for\
        \ the inference of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that overlap copy number\
        \ alterations. The method is based on modelling the notion that genomic regions\
        \ of segmental duplication and amplification induce an extended genotype space\
        \ where a subset of genotypes will exhibit heavily skewed allelic distributions\
        \ in SNVs (and therefore render them undetectable by methods that assume diploidy).\
        \ We introduce the concept of modelling allelic counts from sequencing data\
        \ using a panel of Binomial mixture models where the number of mixtures for\
        \ a given locus in the genome is informed by a discrete copy number state\
        \ given as input. We applied CoNAn-SNV to a previously published whole genome\
        \ shotgun data set obtained from a lobular breast cancer and show that it\
        \ is able to discover 21 experimentally revalidated somatic non-synonymous\
        \ mutations in a lobular breast cancer genome that were not detected using\
        \ copy number insensitive SNV detection algorithms. Importantly, ROC analysis\
        \ shows that the increased sensitivity of CoNAn-SNV does not result in disproportionate\
        \ loss of specificity. This was also supported by analysis of a recently published\
        \ lymphoma genome with a relatively quiescent karyotype, where CoNAn-SNV showed\
        \ similar results to other callers except in regions of copy number gain where\
        \ increased sensitivity was conferred. Our results indicate that in genomically\
        \ unstable tumors, copy number annotation for SNV detection will be critical\
        \ to fully characterize the mutational landscape of cancer genomes. \xA9 2012\
