      abstract: "\xA9 2018 The Author(s). On behalf of The Human Proteome Organization\
        \ (HUPO) Proteomics Standards Initiative, we introduce here two novel standard\
        \ data formats, proBAM and proBed, that have been developed to address the\
        \ current challenges of integrating mass spectrometry-based proteomics data\
        \ with genomics and transcriptomics information in proteogenomics studies.\
        \ proBAM and proBed are adaptations of the well-defined, widely used file\
        \ formats SAM/BAM and BED, respectively, and both have been extended to meet\
        \ the specific requirements entailed by proteomics data. Therefore, existing\
        \ popular genomics tools such as SAMtools and Bedtools, and several widely\
        \ used genome browsers, can already be used to manipulate and visualize these\
        \ formats \"out-of-the-box.\" We also highlight that a number of specific\
        \ additional software tools, properly supporting the proteomics information\
        \ available in these formats, are now available providing functionalities\
        \ such as file generation, file conversion, and data analysis. All the related\
        \ documentation, including the detailed file format specifications and example\
        \ files, are accessible at http://www.psidev.info/probamand at http://www.psidev.info/probed."
