description: MS-Deconv is a combinatorial algorithm for spectral deconvolution. The
  algorithm first generates a large set of candidate isotopomer envelopes for a spectrum,
  then represents the spectrum as a graph, and finally selects its highest scoring
  subset of envelopes as a heaviest path in the graph.

      abstract: "Top-down proteomics studies intact proteins, enabling new opportunities\
        \ for analyzing post-translational modifications. Because tandem mass spectra\
        \ of intact proteins are very complex, spectral deconvolution (grouping peaks\
        \ into isotopomer envelopes) is a key initial stage for their interpretation.\
        \ In such spectra, isotopomer envelopes of different protein fragments span\
        \ overlapping regions on the m/z axis and even share spectral peaks. This\
        \ raises both pattern recognition and combinatorial challenges for spectral\
        \ deconvolution. We present MS-Deconv, a combinatorial algorithm for spectral\
        \ deconvolution. The algorithm first generates a large set of candidate isotopomer\
        \ envelopes for a spectrum, then represents the spectrum as a graph, and finally\
        \ selects its highest scoring subset of envelopes as a heaviest path in the\
        \ graph. In contrast with other approaches, the algorithm scores sets of envelopes\
        \ rather than individual envelopes. We demonstrate that MS-Deconv improves\
        \ on Thrash and Xtract in the number of correctly recovered monoisotopic masses\
        \ and speed. We applied MS-Deconv to a large set of top-down spectra from\
        \ Yersinia rohdei (with a still unsequenced genome) and further matched them\
        \ against the protein database of related and sequenced bacterium Yersinia\
        \ enterocolitica. MS-Deconv is available at http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software.html.\
