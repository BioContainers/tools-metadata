      abstract: 'Motivation: In the light of several ongoing structural genomics projects,
        faster and more reliable methods for structure calculation from NMR data are
        in great demand. The major bottleneck in the determination of solution NMR
        structures is the assignment of NOE peaks (nuclear Overhauser effect). Due
        to the high complexity of the assignment problem, most NOEs cannot be directly
        converted into unambiguous inter-proton distance restraints. Results: We present
        version 1.2 of our program ARIA (Ambiguous Restraints for Iterative Assignment)
        for automated assignment of NOE data and NMR structure calculation. We summarize
        recent progress in correcting for spin diffusion with a relaxation matrix
        approach, representing non-bonded interactions in the force field and refining
        final structures in explicit solvent. We also discuss book-keeping, data exchange
        with spectra assignment programs and deposition of the analysed experimental
        data to the databases.'
