description: Data resource (Parente et al., 2016; doi:10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2015.12.001)
  collecting taxonomic composition and related metadata of > 2300 food and food-related
  samples. Data were produced according to a standardized pipeline and each sample
  is identified according the FoodEx2 classification (developed by the European Food
  Safety Authority to facilitate the comparison among different studies).

    abstract: 'Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. Amplicon targeted high-throughput
      sequencing has become a popular tool for the culture-independent analysis of
      microbial communities. Although the data obtained with this approach are portable
      and the number of sequences available in public databases is increasing, no
      tool has been developed yet for the analysis and presentation of data obtained
      in different studies. This work describes an approach for the development of
      a database for the rapid exploration and analysis of data on food microbial
      communities. Data from seventeen studies investigating the structure of bacterial
      communities in dairy, meat, sourdough and fermented vegetable products, obtained
      by 16S rRNA gene targeted high-throughput sequencing, were collated and analysed
      using Gephi, a network analysis software. The resulting database, which we named
      FoodMicrobionet, was used to analyse nodes and network properties and to build
      an interactive web-based visualisation. The latter allows the visual exploration
      of the relationships between Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and samples
      and the identification of core- and sample-specific bacterial communities. It
      also provides additional search tools and hyperlinks for the rapid selection
      of food groups and OTUs and for rapid access to external resources (NCBI taxonomy,
      digital versions of the original articles). Microbial interaction network analysis
      was carried out using CoNet on datasets extracted from FoodMicrobionet: the
      complexity of interaction networks was much lower than that found for other
      bacterial communities (human microbiome, soil and other environments). This
      may reflect both a bias in the dataset (which was dominated by fermented foods
      and starter cultures) and the lower complexity of food bacterial communities.
      Although some technical challenges exist, and are discussed here, the net result
      is a valuable tool for the exploration of food bacterial communities by the
      scientific community and food industry.'
