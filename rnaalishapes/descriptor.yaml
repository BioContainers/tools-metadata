      abstract: "\xA9 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights\
        \ reserved. Motivation: Abstract shape analysis, first proposed in 2004, allows\
        \ one to extract several relevant structures from the folding space of an\
        \ RNA sequence, preferable to focusing in a single structure of minimal free\
        \ energy. We report recent extensions to this approach. Results: We have rebuilt\
        \ the original RNAshapes as a repository of components that allows us to integrate\
        \ several established tools for RNA structure analysis: RNAshapes, RNAalishapes\
        \ and pknotsRG, including its recent extension pKiss. As a spin-off, we obtain\
        \ heretofore unavailable functionality: e. g. with pKiss, we can now perform\
        \ abstract shape analysis for structures holding pseudoknots up to the complexity\
        \ of kissing hairpin motifs. The new tool pAliKiss can predict kissing hairpin\
        \ motifs from aligned sequences. Along with the integration, the functionality\
        \ of the tools was also extended in manifold ways."
