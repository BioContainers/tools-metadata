description: Computer software for identifying protein by serching against protein
  database with the input Peptide-Mass Fingerprinting Data. It can handle the issues
  of selecting peaks from mass spectrum, transforming database format, displaying
  the top ranks of identification result, and detailed information for each ranking.

      abstract: Protein identification by mass spectrometry (MS) is an important technique
        in proteomics. By searching an MS spectrum against a given protein database,
        the most matched proteins are sorted using a scoring function and the top
        one is often considered the correctly identified protein. Peptide mass fingerprinting
        (PMF) is one of the major methods for protein identification using MS technology.
        It is faster and cheaper than the other popular technique - Tandem Mass Spectrometry.
        Key bioinformatics issues in PMF analysis include designing a scoring function
        to quantitatively measure the degree of consistency between a PMF spectrum
        and a protein sequence and assessing the confidence of identified proteins.
        In this chapter, we will introduce several scoring functions that were developed
        by others and us. We will also provide a new statistic model to evaluate the
        confidence of the score and make an improvement for ranking proteins in protein
        identification. Our developments have been implemented in a software package
        "ProteinDecision," which is available at http://digbio.missouri.edu/ProteinDecision/
        .
