description: A method using concept profile technology to expose from the biomedical

      abstract: "\xA9 2016 Hettne et al. This is an open access article distributed\
        \ under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits\
        \ unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided\
        \ the original author and source are credited. High-throughput experimental\
        \ methods such as medical sequencing and genome-wide association studies (GWAS)\
        \ identify increasingly large numbers of potential relations between genetic\
        \ variants and diseases. Both biological complexity (millions of potential\
        \ gene-disease associations) and the accelerating rate of data production\
        \ necessitate computational approaches to prioritize and rationalize potential\
        \ gene-disease relations. Here, we use concept profile technology to expose\
        \ from the biomedical literature both explicitly stated gene-disease relations\
        \ (the explicitome) and a much larger set of implied gene-disease associations\
        \ (the implicitome). Implicit relations are largely unknown to, or are even\
        \ unintended by the original authors, but they vastly extend the reach of\
        \ existing biomedical knowledge for identification and interpretation of gene-disease\
        \ associations. The implicitome can be used in conjunction with experimental\
        \ data resources to rationalize both known and novel associations. We demonstrate\
        \ the usefulness of the implicitome by rationalizing known and novel gene-disease\
        \ associations, including those from GWAS. To facilitate the re-use of implicit\
        \ gene-disease associations, we publish our data in compliance with FAIR Data\
        \ Publishing recommendations [https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup] using\
        \ nanopublications. An online tool (http://knowledge.bio) is available to\
        \ explore established and potential gene-disease associations in the context\
        \ of other biomedical relations."
