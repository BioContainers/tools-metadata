description: Homology search tool which can detect remote homologues like BLAST and
  is about 200 times more efficient than BLAST by using database subsequence clustering.
  GHOSTZ outputs search results in the format similar to BLAST-tabular format.

      abstract: "\xA9 2014 The Author. Motivation: Sequence homology searches are\
        \ used in various fields. New sequencing technologies produce huge amounts\
        \ of sequence data, which continuously increase the size of sequence databases.\
        \ As a result, homology searches require large amounts of computational time,\
        \ especially for metagenomic analysis. Results: We developed a fast homology\
        \ search method based on database subsequence clustering, and implemented\
        \ it as GHOSTZ. This method clusters similar subsequences from a database\
        \ to perform an efficient seed search and ungapped extension by reducing alignment\
        \ candidates based on triangle inequality. The database subsequence clustering\
        \ technique achieved an \xE2 1/42-fold increase in speed without a large decrease\
        \ in search sensitivity. When we measured with metagenomic data, GHOSTZ is\
        \ \xE2 1/42.2-2.8 times faster than RAPSearch and is \xE2 1/4185-261 times\
        \ faster than BLASTX. Availability and implementation: The source code is\
        \ freely available for download at http://www.bi.cs.titech.ac.jp/ghostz/."
