      abstract: "\xA9 2016 Tuncbag et al.High-throughput, \u2018omic\u2019 methods\
        \ provide sensitive measures of biological responses to perturbations. However,\
        \ inherent biases in high-throughput assays make it difficult to interpret\
        \ experiments in which more than one type of data is collected. In this work,\
        \ we introduce Omics Integrator, a software package that takes a variety of\
        \ \u2018omic\u2019 data as input and identifies putative underlying molecular\
        \ pathways. The approach applies advanced network optimization algorithms\
        \ to a network of thousands of molecular interactions to find high-confidence,\
        \ interpretable subnetworks that best explain the data. These subnetworks\
        \ connect changes observed in gene expression, protein abundance or other\
        \ global assays to proteins that may not have been measured in the screens\
        \ due to inherent bias or noise in measurement. This approach reveals unannotated\
        \ molecular pathways that would not be detectable by searching pathway databases.\
        \ Omics Integrator also provides an elegant framework to incorporate not only\
        \ positive data, but also negative evidence. Incorporating negative evidence\
        \ allows Omics Integrator to avoid unexpressed genes and avoid being biased\
        \ toward highly-studied hub proteins, except when they are strongly implicated\
        \ by the data. The software is comprised of two individual tools, Garnet and\
        \ Forest, that can be run together or independently to allow a user to perform\
        \ advanced integration of multiple types of high-throughput data as well as\
        \ create condition-specific subnetworks of protein interactions that best\
        \ connect the observed changes in various datasets. It is available at http://fraenkel.mit.edu/omicsintegrator\
        \ and on GitHub at https://github.com/fraenkel-lab/OmicsIntegrator."
