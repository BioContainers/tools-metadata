    abstract: 'Motivation: To understand protein structure, folding and function fully
      and to design proteins de novo reliably, we must learn from natural protein
      structures that have been characterized experimentally. The number of protein
      structures available is large and growing exponentially, which makes this task
      challenging. Indeed, computational resources are becoming increasingly important
      for classifying and analyzing this resource. Here, we use tools from graph theory
      to define an Atlas classification scheme for automatically categorizing certain
      protein substructures. Results: Focusing on the α-helical coiled coils, which
      are ubiquitous protein-structure and protein-protein interaction motifs, we
      present a suite of computational resources designed for analyzing these assemblies.
      iSOCKET enables interactive analysis of side-chain packing within proteins to
      identify coiled coils automatically and with considerable user control. Applying
      a graph theory-based Atlas classification scheme to structures identified by
      iSOCKET gives the Atlas of Coiled Coils, a fully automated, updated overview
      of extant coiled coils. The utility of this approach is illustrated with the
      first formal classification of an emerging subclass of coiled coils called α-helical
      barrels. Furthermore, in the Atlas, the known coiled-coil universe is presented
      alongside a partial enumeration of the ''dark matter'' of coiled-coil structures;
      i.e. those coiled-coil architectures that are theoretically possible but have
      not been observed to date, and thus present defined targets for protein design.
      Availability and implementation: iSOCKET is available as part of the open-source
      GitHub repository associated with this work (https://github.com/woolfson-group/isocket).
      This repository also contains all the data generated when classifying the protein
      graphs. The Atlas of Coiled Coils is available at: http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/atlas/app.'
