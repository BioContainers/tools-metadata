description: 'It is a relational database designed to store in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation
  data extracted from the scientific literature and phosphoproteomic analyses. The
  resource comprises serine, threonine and tyrosine non-redundant phosphorylation
  sites. New features include: structural disorder/order and accessibility information
  and a conservation score. Additionally, the conservation of the phosphosites can
  be visualized directly on the multiple sequence alignment used for the score calculation.'

    abstract: The Phospho.ELM resource (http://phospho.elm.eu.org) is a relational
      database designed to store in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation data extracted
      from the scientific literature and phosphoproteomicanalyses. The resource has
      been actively developed for more than 7 years and currently comprises 42 574
      serine, threonine and tyrosine non-redundant phosphorylation sites. Several
      new features have been implemented, such as structural disorder/ order and accessibility
      information and a conservation score. Additionally, the conservation of the
      phosphosites can now be visualized directly on the multiple sequence alignment
      used for the score calculation. Finally, special emphasis has been put on linking
      to external resources such as interaction networks and other databases. © The
      Author(s) 2010.
