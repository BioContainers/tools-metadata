      abstract: "We have developed omniBiomarker, a web-based application that uses\
        \ knowledge from the NCI Cancer Gene Index to guide the selection of biologically\
        \ relevant algorithms for identifying biomarkers. Biomarker identification\
        \ from high-throughput genomic expression data is difficult because of data\
        \ properties (i.e., small-sample size compared to large-feature size) as well\
        \ as the large number of available feature selection algorithms. Thus, it\
        \ is unclear which algorithm should be used for a particular dataset. These\
        \ factors lead to instability in biomarker identification and affect the reproducibility\
        \ of results. We introduce a method for computing the biological relevance\
        \ of feature selection algorithms using an externally validated knowledge\
        \ base of manually curated cancer biomarkers. Results suggest that knowledge-driven\
        \ biomarker identification can improve microarray-based clinical prediction\
        \ performance. omniBiomarker can be accessed at http://omnibiomarker.bme.gatech.edu/.\
