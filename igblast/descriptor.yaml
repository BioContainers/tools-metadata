    metadata:
      abstract: The variable domain of an immunoglobulin (IG) sequence is encoded
        by multiple genes, including the variable (V) gene, the diversity (D) gene
        and the joining (J) gene. Analysis of IG sequences typically requires identification
        of each gene, as well as a comparison of sequence variations in the context
        of defined regions. General purpose tools, such as the BLAST program, have
        only limited use for such tasks, as the rearranged nature of an IG sequence
        and the variable length of each gene requires multiple rounds of BLAST searches
        for a single IG sequence. Additionally, manual assembly of different genes
        is difficult and error-prone. To address these issues and to facilitate other
        common tasks in analysing IG sequences, we have developed the sequence analysis
        tool IgBLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/). With this tool, users
        can view the matches to the germline V, D and J genes, details at rearrangement
        junctions, the delineation of IG V domain framework regions and complementarity
        determining regions. IgBLAST has the capability to analyse nucleotide and
        protein sequences and can process sequences in batches. Furthermore, IgBLAST
        allows searches against the germline gene databases and other sequence databases
        simultaneously to minimize the chance of missing possibly the best matching
        germline V gene.
