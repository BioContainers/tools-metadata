      abstract: "Recent emergence of new mass spectrometry techniques (e.g. electron\
        \ transfer dissociation, ETD) and improved availability of additional proteases\
        \ (e.g. Lys-N) for protein digestion in high-throughput experiments raised\
        \ the challenge of designing new algorithms for interpreting the resulting\
        \ new types of tandem mass (MS/MS) spectra. Traditional MS/MS database search\
        \ algorithms such as SEQUEST and Mascot were originally designed for collision\
        \ induced dissociation (CID) of tryptic peptides and are largely based on\
        \ expert knowledge about fragmentation of tryptic peptides (rather than machine\
        \ learning techniques) to design CID-specific scoring functions. As a result,\
        \ the performance of these algorithms is suboptimal for new mass spectrometry\
        \ technologies or nontryptic peptides. We recently proposed the generating\
        \ function approach (MS-GF) for CID spectra of tryptic peptides. In this study,\
        \ we extend MS-GF to automatically derive scoring parameters from a set of\
        \ annotated MS/MS spectra of any type (e.g. CID, ETD, etc.), and present a\
        \ new database search tool MS-GFDB based on MS-GF. We show that MS-GFDB outperforms\
        \ Mascot for ETD spectra or peptides digested with Lys-N. For example, in\
        \ the case of ETD spectra, the number of tryptic and Lys-N peptides identified\
        \ by MS-GFDB increased by a factor of 2.7 and 2.6 as compared with Mascot.\
        \ Moreover, even following a decade of Mascot developments for analyzing CID\
        \ spectra of tryptic peptides, MS-GFDB (that is not particularly tailored\
        \ for CID spectra or tryptic peptides) resulted in 28% increase over Mascot\
        \ in the number of peptide identifications. Finally, we propose a statistical\
        \ framework for analyzing multiple spectra from the same precursor (e.g. CID/ETD\
        \ spectral pairs) and assigning p values to peptide-spectrum-spectrum matches.\
