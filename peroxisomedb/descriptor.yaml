description: Complete peroxisomal proteome of H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae, as well
  as 35 newly sequenced eukaryotic genomes. Version 2.0 integrates the peroxisomal
  metabolome of whole microbody familiy by the new incorporation of the glycosome
  proteomes of trypanosomatids and the glyoxysome proteome of A. thaliana. The database
  includes phylogenetic trees and tools to capture kinetic information from Brenda,
  CheBI and Sabio-RK databases and selected bibliographic references.

      abstract: "Peroxisomes are essential organelles that play a key role in redox\
        \ signalling and lipid homeostasis. They contain a highly diverse enzymatic\
        \ network among different species, mirroring the varied metabolic needs of\
        \ the organisms. The previous PeroxisomeDB version organized the peroxisomal\
        \ proteome of humans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on genetic and functional\
        \ information into metabolic categories with a special focus on peroxisomal\
        \ disease. The new release (http://www.peroxisomeDB.org) adds peroxisomal\
        \ proteins from 35 newly sequenced eukaryotic genomes including fungi, yeasts,\
        \ plants and lower eukaryotes. We searched these genomes for a core ensemble\
        \ of 139 peroxisomal protein families and identified 2706 putative peroxisomal\
        \ protein homologs. Approximately 37% of the identified homologs contained\
        \ putative peroxisome targeting signals (PTS). To help develop understanding\
        \ of the evolutionary relationships among peroxisomal proteins, the new database\
        \ includes phylogenetic trees for 2386 of the peroxisomal proteins. Additional\
        \ new features are provided, such as a tool to capture kinetic information\
        \ from Brenda, CheBI and Sabio-RK databases and more than 1400 selected bibliographic\
        \ references. PeroxisomeDB 2.0 is a freely available, highly interactive functional\
        \ genomics platform that offers an extensive view on the peroxisomal metabolome\
        \ across lineages, thus facilitating comparative genomics and systems analysis\
        \ of the organelle. \xA9 The Author(s) 2009. Published by Oxford University\
