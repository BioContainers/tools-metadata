      abstract: "\xA9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.Mass\
        \ spectrometry (MS) instruments and experimental protocols are rapidly advancing,\
        \ but the software tools to analyse tandem mass spectra are lagging behind.\
        \ We present a database search tool MS-GF+ that is sensitive (it identifies\
        \ more peptides than most other database search tools) and universal (it works\
        \ well for diverse types of spectra, different configurations of MS instruments\
        \ and different experimental protocols). We benchmark MS-GF+ using diverse\
        \ spectral data sets: (i) spectra of varying fragmentation methods; (ii) spectra\
        \ of multiple enzyme digests; (iii) spectra of phosphorylated peptides; and\
        \ (iv) spectra of peptides with unusual fragmentation propensities produced\
        \ by a novel alpha-lytic protease. For all these data sets, MS-GF+ significantly\
        \ increases the number of identified peptides compared with commonly used\
        \ methods for peptide identifications. We emphasize that although MS-GF+ is\
        \ not specifically designed for any particular experimental set-up, it improves\
        \ on the performance of tools specifically designed for these applications\
        \ (for example, specialized tools for phosphoproteomics)."
