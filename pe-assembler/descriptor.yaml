      abstract: "Motivation: Many de novo genome assemblers have been proposed recently.\
        \ The basis for most existing methods relies on the de bruijn graph: a complex\
        \ graph structure that attempts to encompass the entire genome. Such graphs\
        \ can be prohibitively large, may fail to capture subtle information and is\
        \ difficult to be parallelized. Result: We present a method that eschews the\
        \ traditional graphbased approach in favor of a simple 3' extension approach\
        \ that has potential to be massively parallelized. Our results show that it\
        \ is able to obtain assemblies that are more contiguous, complete and less\
        \ error prone compared with existing methods. \xA9 The Author 2010. Published\
