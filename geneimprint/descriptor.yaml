      abstract: 'Although we inherit two copies of all genes, except those that reside
        on the sex chromosomes, there is a subset of these genes in which only the
        paternal or maternal copy is functional. This phenomenon of monoallelic, parent-of-origin
        expression of genes is termed genomic imprinting. Imprinted genes are normally
        involved in embryonic growth and behavioral development, but occasionally
        they also function inappropriately as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
        The evidence that imprinted genes play a role in carcinogenesis will be discussed
        in this review. Additional information about imprinted genes can be found
        on the Genomic Imprinting Website at: (httpd/www.geneimprint.com).'

    metadata:
      abstract: Genomic imprinting refers to an epigenetic marking of genes that results
        in monoallelic expression. This parent-of-origin dependent phenomenon is a
        notable exception to the laws of Mendelian genetics. Imprinted genes are intricately
        involved in fetal and behavioral development. Consequently, abnormal expression
        of these genes results in numerous human genetic disorders including carcinogenesis.
        This paper reviews genomic imprinting and its role in human disease. Additional
        information about imprinted genes can be found on the Genomic Imprinting Website
        at http://www.geneimprint.com.
