      abstract: "Background: Mass spectrometry based quantification of peptides can\
        \ be performed using the iTRAQ\u2122 reagent in conjunction with mass spectrometry.\
        \ This technology yields information about the relative abundance of single\
        \ peptides. A method for the calculation of reliable quantification information\
        \ is required in order to obtain biologically relevant data at the protein\
        \ expression level. Results: A method comprising sound error estimation and\
        \ statistical methods is presented that allows precise abundance analysis\
        \ plus error calculation at the peptide as well as at the protein level. This\
        \ yields the relevant information that is required for quantitative proteomics.\
        \ Comparing the performance of our method named Quant with existing approaches\
        \ the error estimation is reliable and offers information for precise bioinformatic\
        \ models. Quant is shown to generate results that are consistent with those\
        \ produced by ProQuant\u2122, thus validating both systems. Moreover, the\
        \ results are consistent with that of Mascot\u2122 2.2. The MATLAB\xAE scripts\
        \ of Quant are freely available via http://www.protein-ms.de and http://sourceforge.net/projects/protms/,\
        \ each under the GNU Lesser General Public License. Conclusion: The software\
        \ Quant demonstrates improvements in protein quantification using iTRAQ\u2122\
        . Precise quantification data can be obtained at the protein level when using\
        \ error propagation and adequate visualization. Quant integrates both and\
        \ additionally provides the possibility to obtain more reliable results by\
        \ calculation of wise quality measures. Peak area integration has been replaced\
        \ by sum of intensities, yielding more reliable quantification results. Additionally,\
        \ Quant allows the combination of quantitative information obtained by iTRAQ\u2122\
        \ with peptide and protein identifications from popular tandem MS identification\
        \ tools. Hence Quant is a useful tool for the proteomics community and may\
        \ help improving analysis of proteomic experimental data. In addition, we\
        \ have shown that a lognormal distribution fits the data of mass spectrometry\
        \ based relative peptide quantification. \xA9 2007 Boehm et al; licensee BioMed\
