      abstract: "Proteogenomic searching is a useful method for identifying novel\
        \ proteins, annotating genes and detecting peptides unique to an individual\
        \ genome. The approach, however, can be laborious, as it often requires search\
        \ segmentation and the use of several unintegrated tools. Furthermore, many\
        \ proteogenomic efforts have been limited to small genomes, as large genomes\
        \ can prove impractical due to the required amount of computer memory and\
        \ computation time. We present Peppy, a software tool designed to perform\
        \ every necessary task of proteogenomic searches quickly, accurately and automatically.\
        \ The software generates a peptide database from a genome, tracks peptide\
        \ loci, matches peptides to MS/MS spectra and assigns confidence values to\
        \ those matches. Peppy automatically performs a decoy database generation,\
        \ search and analysis to return identifications at the desired false discovery\
        \ rate threshold. Written in Java for cross-platform execution, the software\
        \ is fully multithreaded for enhanced speed. The program can run on regular\
        \ desktop computers, opening the doors of proteogenomic searching to a wider\
        \ audience of proteomics and genomics researchers. Peppy is available at http://geneffects.com/peppy.\
