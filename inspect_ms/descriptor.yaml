description: Inspect is a general purpose database search algorithm, with an emphasis
  on efficiently and confidently identifying modified peptides. It includes special
  scoring models for phosphorylation which allow for increased accuracy. In addition,
  Inspect implements the MS-Alignment algorithm for discovery of unanticipated modifications
  in blind mode.

      abstract: "Reliable identification of posttranslational modifications is key\
        \ to understanding various cellular regulatory processes. We describe a tool,\
        \ InsPecT, to identify posttranslational modifications using tandem mass spectrometry\
        \ data. InsPecT constructs database filters that proved to be very successful\
        \ in genomics searches. Given an MS/MS spectrum S and a database D, a database\
        \ filter selects a small fraction of database D that is guaranteed (with high\
        \ probability) to contain a peptide that produced S. InsPecT uses peptide\
        \ sequence tags as efficient filters that reduce the size of the database\
        \ by a few orders of magnitude while retaining the correct peptide with very\
        \ high probability. In addition to filtering, InsPecT also uses novel algorithms\
        \ for scoring and validating in the presence of modifications, without explicit\
        \ enumeration of all variants. InsPecT identifies modified peptides with better\
        \ or equivalent accuracy than other database search tools while being 2 orders\
        \ of magnitude faster than SEQUEST, and substantially faster than X!TANDEM\
        \ on complex mixtures. The tool was used to identify a number of novel modifications\
        \ in different data sets, including many phosphopetides in data provided by\
        \ Alliance for Cellular Signaling that were missed by other tools. \xA9 2005\
