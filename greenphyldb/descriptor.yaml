description: A database designed for comparative and functional genomics based on
  complete genomes. It contains full genomes of members of the plantae kingdom, ranging
  from algae to angiosperms, automatically clustered into gene families. Gene families
  are manually annotated and then analyzed phylogenetically in order to elucidate
  orthologous and paralogous relationships. The database offers various lists of gene
  families including plant, phylum and species specific gene families.

  metadata:
    abstract: GreenPhylDB is a database designed for comparative and functional genomics
      based on complete genomes. Version 2 now contains sixteen full genomes of members
      of the plantae kingdom, ranging from algae to angiosperms, automatically clustered
      into gene families. Gene families are manually annotated and then analyzed phylogenetically
      in order to elucidate orthologous and paralogous relationships. The database
      offers various lists of gene families including plant, phylum and species specific
      gene families. For each gene cluster or gene family, easy access to gene composition,
      protein domains, publications, external links and orthologous gene predictions
      is provided. Web interfaces have been further developed to improve the navigation
      through information related to gene families. New analysis tools are also available,
      such as a gene family ontology browser that facilitates exploration. GreenPhylDB
      is a component of the South Green Bioinformatics Platform (http:// southgreen.cirad.fr/)
      and is accessible at http:// greenphyl.cirad.fr. It enables comparative genomics
      in a broad taxonomy context to enhance the understanding of evolutionary processes
      and thus tends to speed up gene discovery. Â© The Author(s) 2010.
