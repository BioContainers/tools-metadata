      abstract: "Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM\u2122) is a comprehensive,\
        \ authoritative and timely knowledgebase of human genes and genetic disorders\
        \ compiled to support human genetics research and education and the practice\
        \ of clinical genetics. Started by Dr Victor A. McKusick as the definitive\
        \ reference Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/)\
        \ is now distributed electronically by the National Center for Biotechnology\
        \ Information, where it is integrated with the Entrez suite of databases.\
        \ Derived from the biomedical literature, OMIM is written and edited at Johns\
        \ Hopkins University with input from scientists and physicians around the\
        \ world. Each OMIM entry has a full-text summary of a genetically determined\
        \ phenotype and/or gene and has numerous links to other genetic databases\
        \ such as DNA and protein sequence, PubMed references, general and locus-specific\
        \ mutation databases, HUGO nomenclature, MapViewer, GeneTests, patient support\
        \ groups and many others. OMIM is an easy and straightforward portal to the\
        \ burgeoning information in human genetics. \xA9 Oxford University Press 2005;\
