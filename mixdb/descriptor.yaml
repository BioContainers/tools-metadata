      abstract: "In high-throughput proteomics the development of computational methods\
        \ and novel experimental strategies often rely on each other. In certain areas,\
        \ mass spectrometry methods for data acquisition are ahead of computational\
        \ methods to interpret the resulting tandem mass spectra. Particularly, although\
        \ there are numerous situations in which a mixture tandem mass spectrum can\
        \ contain fragment ions from two or more peptides, nearly all database search\
        \ tools still make the assumption that each tandem mass spectrum comes from\
        \ one peptide. Common examples include mixture spectra from co-eluting peptides\
        \ in complex samples, spectra generated from data-independent acquisition\
        \ methods, and spectra from peptides with complex post-translational modifications.\
        \ We propose a new database search tool (MixDB) that is able to identify mixture\
        \ tandem mass spectra from more than one peptide. We show that peptides can\
        \ be reliably identified with up to 95% accuracy from mixture spectra while\
        \ considering only a 0.01% of all possible peptide pairs (four orders of magnitude\
        \ speedup). Comparison with current database search methods indicates that\
        \ our approach has better or comparable sensitivity and precision at identifying\
        \ single-peptide spectra while simultaneously being able to identify 38% more\
        \ peptides from mixture spectra at significantly higher precision. \xA9 2011\
