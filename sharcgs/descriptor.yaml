      abstract: "The latest revolution in the DNA sequencing field has been brought\
        \ about by the development of automated sequencers that are capable of generating\
        \ giga base pair data sets quickly and at low cost. Applications of such technologies\
        \ seem to be limited to resequencing and transcript discovery, due to the\
        \ shortness of the generated reads. In order to extend the fields of application\
        \ to de novo sequencing, we developed the SHARCGS algorithm to assemble short-read\
        \ (25-40-mer) data with high accuracy and speed. The efficiency of SHARCGS\
        \ was tested on BAC inserts from three eukaryotic species, on two yeast chromosomes,\
        \ and on two bacterial genomes (Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli).\
        \ We show that 30-mer-based BAC assemblies have N50 sizes >20 kbp for Drosophila\
        \ and Arabidopsis and >4 kbp for human in simulations taking missing reads\
        \ and wrong base calls into account. We assembled 949,974 contigs with length\
        \ >50 bp, and only one single contig could not be aligned error-free against\
        \ the reference sequences. We generated 36-mer reads for the genome of Helicobacter\
        \ acinonychis on the Illumina 1G sequencing instrument and assembled 937 contigs\
        \ covering 98% of the genome with an N50 size of 3.7 kbp. With the exception\
        \ of five contigs that differ in 1-4 positions relative to the reference sequence,\
        \ all contigs matched the genome error-free. Thus, SHARCGS is a suitable tool\
        \ for fully exploiting novel sequencing technologies by assembling sequence\
        \ contigs de novo with high confidence and by outperforming existing assembly\
        \ algorithms in terms of speed and accuracy. \xA92007 by Cold Spring Harbor\
