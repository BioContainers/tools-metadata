      abstract: "A structural classification of loops has been obtained from a set\
        \ of 141 protein structures classified as kinases. A total of 1813 loops was\
        \ classified into 133 subclasses (9 \u03B2\u03B2links, 15 \u03B2\u03B2 hairpins,\
        \ 31 \u03B1-\u03B1, 46 \u03B1-\u03B2 and 32 \u03B2-\u03B1). Functional information\
        \ and specific features relating subclasses and function were included in\
        \ the classification. Functional loops such as the P-loop (shared by different\
        \ folds) or the Gly-rich-loop, among others, were classified into structural\
        \ motifs. As a result, a common mechanism of catalysis and substrate binding\
        \ was proved for most kinases. Additionally, the multiple-alignment of loop\
        \ sequences made within each subclass was shown to be useful for comparative\
        \ modeling of kinase loops. \xA9 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
