description: Continuously evaluates the accuracy and reliability of protein structure
  prediction methods in a fully automated manner. CAMEO currently assesses predictions
  in two categories (3D protein structure modeling and protein structure model quality
  predictions). The project is open to everyone and has been used by several method
  developer groups to benchmark and monitor their servers and new developments.

      abstract: The Protein Model Portal (PMP) has been developed to foster effective
        use of 3D molecular models in biomedical research by providing convenient
        and comprehensive access to structural information for proteins. Both experimental
        structures and theoretical models for a given protein can be searched simultaneously
        and analyzed for structural variability. By providing a comprehensive view
        on structural information, PMP offers the opportunity to apply consistent
        assessment and validation criteria to the complete set of structural models
        available for proteins. PMP is an open project so that new methods developed
        by the community can contribute to PMP, for example, new modeling servers
        for creating homology models and model quality estimation servers for model
        validation. The accuracy of participating modeling servers is continuously
        evaluated by the Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn (CAMEO) project. The
        PMP offers a unique interface to visualize structural coverage of a protein
        combining both theoretical models and experimental structures, allowing straightforward
        assessment of the model quality and hence their utility. The portal is updated
        regularly and actively developed to include latest methods in the field of
        computational structural biology.
