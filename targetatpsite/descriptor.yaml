      abstract: "Understanding the interactions between proteins and ligands is critical\
        \ for protein function annotations and drug discovery. We report a new sequence-based\
        \ template-free predictor (TargetATPsite) to identify the Adenosine-5\u2032\
        - triphosphate (ATP) binding sites with machine-learning approaches. Two steps\
        \ are implemented in TargetATPsite: binding residues and pockets predictions,\
        \ respectively. To predict the binding residues, a novel image sparse representation\
        \ technique is proposed to encode residue evolution information treated as\
        \ the input features. An ensemble classifier constructed based on support\
        \ vector machines (SVM) from multiple random under-samplings is used as the\
        \ prediction model, which is effective for dealing with imbalance phenomenon\
        \ between the positive and negative training samples. Compared with the existing\
        \ ATP-specific sequence-based predictors, TargetATPsite is featured by the\
        \ second step of possessing the capability of further identifying the binding\
        \ pockets from the predicted binding residues through a spatial clustering\
        \ algorithm. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate\
        \ the efficacy of TargetATPsite. \xA9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
