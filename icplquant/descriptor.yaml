      abstract: "The main goal of many proteomics experiments is an accurate and rapid\
        \ quantification and identification of regulated proteins in complex biological\
        \ samples. The bottleneck in quantitative proteomics remains the availability\
        \ of efficient software to evaluate and quantify the tremendous amount of\
        \ mass spectral data acquired during a proteomics project. A new software\
        \ suite, ICPLQuant, has been developed to accurately quantify isotope-coded\
        \ protein label (ICPL)-labeled peptides on the MS level during LC-MALDI and\
        \ peptide mass fingerprint experiments. The tool is able to generate a list\
        \ of differentially regulated peptide precursors for subsequent MS/MS experiments,\
        \ minimizing time-consuming acquisition and interpretation of MS/MS data.\
        \ ICPLQuant is based on two independent units. Unit 1 performs ICPL multiplex\
        \ detection and quantification and proposes peptides to be identified by MS/MS.\
        \ Unit 2 combines MASCOT MS/MS protein identification with the quantitative\
        \ data and produces a protein/peptide list with all the relevant information\
        \ accessible for further data mining. The accuracy of quantification, selection\
        \ of peptides for MS/MS-identification and the automated output of a protein\
        \ list of regulated proteins are demonstrated by the comparative analysis\
        \ of four different mixtures of three proteins (Ovalbumin, Horseradish Peroxidase\
        \ and Rabbit Albumin) spiked into the complex protein background of the DGPF\
        \ Proteome Marker. \xA9 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA."
