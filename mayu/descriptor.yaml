      abstract: "Comprehensive characterization of a proteome is a fundamental goal\
        \ in proteomics. To achieve saturation coverage of a proteome or specific\
        \ subproteome via tandem mass spectrometric identification of tryptic protein\
        \ sample digests, proteomics data sets are growing dramatically in size and\
        \ heterogeneity. The trend toward very large integrated data sets poses so\
        \ far unsolved challenges to control the uncertainty of protein identifications\
        \ going beyond well established confidence measures for peptide-spectrum matches.\
        \ We present MAYU, a novel strategy that reliably estimates false discovery\
        \ rates for protein identifications in large scale data sets. We validated\
        \ and applied MAYU using various large proteomics data sets. The data show\
        \ that the size of the data set has an important and previously underestimated\
        \ impact on the reliability of protein identifications. We particularly found\
        \ that protein false discovery rates are significantly elevated compared with\
        \ those of peptide-spectrum matches. The function provided by MAYU is critical\
        \ to control the quality of proteome data repositories and thereby to enhance\
        \ any study relying on these data sources. The MAYU software is available\
        \ as standalone software and also integrated into the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline.\
