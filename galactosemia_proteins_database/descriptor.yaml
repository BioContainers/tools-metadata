description: 'It is a a joint ISA-CNR/UniSA project: a database in which information
  are collected and freely available about structural features of three enzymes involved
  in the galactose metabolism, i.e. galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT,
  E.C. 2.7.7.12), galactokinase (GALK, E.C. 2.7.1.6), and UDP-galactose-4''-epimerase
  (GALE, E.C. 5.1.3.2).'

        \ 2.0 is a Web-accessible resource collecting information about the structural\
        \ and functional effects of the known variations associated to the three different\
        \ enzymes of the Leloir pathway encoded by the genes GALT, GALE, and GALK1\
        \ and involved in the different forms of the genetic disease globally called\

        \ resources we previously developed, with new data deriving from new structures,\
        \ new analysis tools, and new interfaces and filters in order to improve the\
        \ quality and quantity of information available for different categories of\
        \ users. We propose this new resource both as a landmark for the entire world\
