      abstract: "Background: Visualisation of genome comparisons is invaluable for\
        \ helping to determine genotypic differences between closely related prokaryotes.\
        \ New visualisation and abstraction methods are required in order to improve\
        \ the validation, interpretation and communication of genome sequence information;\
        \ especially with the increasing amount of data arising from next-generation\
        \ sequencing projects. Visualising a prokaryote genome as a circular image\
        \ has become a powerful means of displaying informative comparisons of one\
        \ genome to a number of others. Several programs, imaging libraries and internet\
        \ resources already exist for this purpose, however, most are either limited\
        \ in the number of comparisons they can show, are unable to adequately utilise\
        \ draft genome sequence data, or require a knowledge of command-line scripting\
        \ for implementation. Currently, there is no freely available desktop application\
        \ that enables users to rapidly visualise comparisons between hundreds of\
        \ draft or complete genomes in a single image.Results: BLAST Ring Image Generator\
        \ (BRIG) can generate images that show multiple prokaryote genome comparisons,\
        \ without an arbitrary limit on the number of genomes compared. The output\
        \ image shows similarity between a central reference sequence and other sequences\
        \ as a set of concentric rings, where BLAST matches are coloured on a sliding\
        \ scale indicating a defined percentage identity. Images can also include\
        \ draft genome assembly information to show read coverage, assembly breakpoints\
        \ and collapsed repeats. In addition, BRIG supports the mapping of unassembled\
        \ sequencing reads against one or more central reference sequences. Many types\
        \ of custom data and annotations can be shown using BRIG, making it a versatile\
        \ approach for visualising a range of genomic comparison data. BRIG is readily\
        \ accessible to any user, as it assumes no specialist computational knowledge\
        \ and will perform all required file parsing and BLAST comparisons automatically.Conclusions:\
        \ There is a clear need for a user-friendly program that can produce genome\
        \ comparisons for a large number of prokaryote genomes with an emphasis on\
        \ rapidly utilising unfinished or unassembled genome data. Here we present\
        \ BRIG, a cross-platform application that enables the interactive generation\
        \ of comparative genomic images via a simple graphical-user interface. BRIG\
        \ is freely available for all operating systems at http://sourceforge.net/projects/brig/.\
