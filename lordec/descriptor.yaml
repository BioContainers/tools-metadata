      abstract: "\xA9 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights\
        \ reserved. Motivation: PacBio single molecule real-time sequencing is a thirdgeneration\
        \ sequencing technique producing long reads, with comparatively lower throughput\
        \ and higher error rate. Errors include numerous indels and complicate downstream\
        \ analysis like mapping or de novo assembly. A hybrid strategy that takes\
        \ advantage of the high accuracy of second-generation short reads has been\
        \ proposed for correcting long reads. Mapping of short reads on long reads\
        \ provides sufficient coverage to eliminate up to 99% of errors, however,\
        \ at the expense of prohibitive running times and considerable amounts of\
        \ disk and memory space. Results: We present LoRDEC, a hybrid error correction\
        \ method that builds a succinct de Bruijn graph representing the short reads,\
        \ and seeks a corrective sequence for each erroneous region in the long reads\
        \ by traversing chosen paths in the graph. In comparison, LoRDEC is at least\
        \ six times faster and requires at least 93% less memory or disk space than\
        \ available tools, while achieving comparable accuracy."
