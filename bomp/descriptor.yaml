description: The beta-barrel Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP) takes one or
  more fasta-formatted polypeptide sequences from Gram-negative bacteria as input
  and predicts whether or not they are beta-barrel integral outer membrane proteins.

      abstract: "This work describes the development of a program that predicts whether\
        \ or not a polypeptide sequence from a Gram-negative bacterium is an integral\
        \ \u03B2-barrel outer membrane protein. The program, called the \u03B2-barrel\
        \ Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP), is based on two separate components\
        \ to recognize integral \u03B2-barrel proteins. The first component is a C-terminal\
        \ pattern typical of many integral \u03B2 -barrel proteins. The second component\
        \ calculates an integral \u03B2 -barrel score of the sequence based on the\
        \ extent to which the sequence contains stretches of amino acids typical of\
        \ transmembrane \u03B2 -strands. The precision of the predictions was found\
        \ to be 80% with a recall of 88% when tested on the proteins with SwissProt\
        \ annotated subcellular localization in Escherichia coli K 12 (788 sequences)\
        \ and Salmonella typhimurium (366 sequences). When tested on the predicted\
        \ proteome of E. coli, BOMP found 103 of a total of 4346 polypeptide sequences\
        \ to be possible integral \u03B2-barrel proteins. Of these, 36 were found\
        \ by BLAST to lack similarity (E-value score < 1e-10) to proteins with annotated\
        \ subcellular localization in SwissProt. BOMP predicted the content of integral\
        \ \u03B2-barrels per predicted proteome of 10 different bacteria to range\
        \ from 1.8 to 3%. BOMP is available at http://www.bioinfo.no/tools/bomp. \xA9\
