description: 'A program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats and low
  complexity DNA sequences. The output of the program is a detailed annotation of
  the repeats that are present in the query sequence as well as a modified version
  of the query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked (default:
  replaced by Ns).'
