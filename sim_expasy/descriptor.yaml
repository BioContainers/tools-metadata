description: SIM finds a user-defined number of best non-intersecting alignments between
  two protein sequences or within a sequence. Results can be viewed with LALNVIEW,
  a graphical viewer program for pairwise alignments.

      abstract: "Dynamic programming algorithms to determine similar regions of two\
        \ sequences are useful for analyzing biosequence data. This paper presents\
        \ a time-efficient algorithm that produces k best \"non-intersecting\" local\
        \ alignments for any chosen k. The algorithm's main strength is that it needs\
        \ only O(M + N + K) space, where M and N are the lengths of the given sequences\
        \ and K is the total length of the computed alignments. \xA9 1991."
