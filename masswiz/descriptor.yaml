      abstract: "Mass spectrometry has made rapid advances in the recent past and\
        \ has become the preferred method for proteomics. Although many open source\
        \ algorithms for peptide identification exist, such as X!Tandem and OMSSA,\
        \ it has majorly been a domain of proprietary software. There is a need for\
        \ better, freely available, and configurable algorithms that can help in identifying\
        \ the correct peptides while keeping the false positives to a minimum. We\
        \ have developed MassWiz, a novel empirical scoring function that gives appropriate\
        \ weights to major ions, continuity of b-y ions, intensities, and the supporting\
        \ neutral losses based on the instrument type. We tested MassWiz accuracy\
        \ on 486,882 spectra from a standard mixture of 18 proteins generated on 6\
        \ different instruments downloaded from the Seattle Proteome Center public\
        \ repository. We compared the MassWiz algorithm with Mascot, Sequest, OMSSA,\
        \ and X!Tandem at 1% FDR. MassWiz outperformed all in the largest data set\
        \ (AGILENT XCT) and was second only to Mascot in the other data sets. MassWiz\
        \ showed good performance in the analysis of high confidence peptides, i.e.,\
        \ those identified by at least three algorithms. We also analyzed a yeast\
        \ data set containing 106,133 spectra downloaded from the NCBI Peptidome repository\
        \ and got similar results. The results demonstrate that MassWiz is an effective\
        \ algorithm for high-confidence peptide identification without compromising\
        \ on the number of assignments. MassWiz is open-source, versatile, and easily\
        \ configurable. \xA9 2011 American Chemical Society."
