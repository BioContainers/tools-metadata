description: Bioinformatics platform for high-quality functional annotation and analysis
  of genomic datasets. It allows analyzing and visualizing newly sequenced genomes
  by combining state-of-the-art methodologies, standard resources and algorithms.
  It allows to gain biological insights fast and easy even for completely novel genomes.
  Perform out-of-the-box the entire workflow of functional annotation of your transcriptomic
  datasets including its analysis and biological interpretation.

      abstract: "Summary: We present here Blast2GO (B2G), a research tool designed\
        \ with the main purpose of enabling Gene Ontology (GO) based data mining on\
        \ sequence data for which no GO annotation is yet available. B2G joints in\
        \ one application GO annotation based on similarity searches with statistical\
        \ analysis and highlighted visualization on directed acyclic graphs. This\
        \ tool offers a suitable platform for functional genomics research in non-model\
        \ species. B2G is an intuitive and interactive desktop application that allows\
        \ monitoring and comprehension of the whole annotation and analysis process.\
