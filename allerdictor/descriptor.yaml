      abstract: "Motivation: Accurately identifying and eliminating allergens from\
        \ biotechnology-derived products are important for human health. From a biomedical\
        \ research perspective, it is also important to identify allergens in sequenced\
        \ genomes. Many allergen prediction tools have been developed during the past\
        \ years. Although these tools have achieved certain levels of specificity,\
        \ when applied to large-scale allergen discovery (e.g. at a whole-genome scale),\
        \ they still yield many false positives and thus low precision (even at low\
        \ recall) due to the extreme skewness of the data (allergens are rare). Moreover,\
        \ the most accurate tools are relatively slow because they use protein sequence\
        \ alignment to build feature vectors for allergen classifiers. Additionally,\
        \ only web server implementations of the current allergen prediction tools\
        \ are publicly available and are without the capability of large batch submission.\
        \ These weaknesses make large-scale allergen discovery ineffective and inefficient\
        \ in the public domain.Results: We developed Allerdictor, a fast and accurate\
        \ sequence-based allergen prediction tool that models protein sequences as\
        \ text documents and uses support vector machine in text classification for\
        \ allergen prediction. Test results on multiple highly skewed datasets demonstrated\
        \ that Allerdictor predicted allergens with high precision over high recall\
        \ at fast speed. For example, Allerdictor only took \u223C6 min on a single\
        \ core PC to scan a whole Swiss-Prot database of \u223C540 000 sequences and\
        \ identified <1% of them as allergens. \xA9 2014 The Author."
