description: 'High Ambiguity Driven biomolecular DOCKing: an information-driven flexible
  docking approach for the modeling of biomolecular complexes. It distinguishes itself
  from ab-initio docking methods in the fact that it encodes information from identified
  or predicted protein interfaces in ambiguous interaction restraints (AIRs) to drive
  the docking process. It can deal with a large class of modeling problems including
  protein-protein, protein-nucleic acids and protein-ligand complexes.'

      abstract: "\xA9 2015 The Authors. The prediction of the quaternary structure\
        \ of biomolecular macromolecules is of paramount importance for fundamental\
        \ understanding of cellular processes and drug design. In the era of integrative\
        \ structural biology, one way of increasing the accuracy of modeling methods\
        \ used to predict the structure of biomolecular complexes is to include as\
        \ much experimental or predictive information as possible in the process.\
        \ This has been at the core of our information-driven docking approach HADDOCK.\
        \ We present here the updated version 2.2 of the HADDOCK portal, which offers\
        \ new features such as support for mixed molecule types, additional experimental\
        \ restraints and improved protocols, all of this in a user-friendly interface.\
        \ With well over 6000 registered users and 108,000 jobs served, an increasing\
        \ fraction of which on grid resources, we hope that this timely upgrade will\
        \ help the community to solve important biological questions and further advance\
        \ the field. The HADDOCK2.2 Web server is freely accessible to non-profit\
        \ users at http://haddock.science.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK2.2."

    metadata:
      abstract: "The structure determination of protein-protein complexes is a rather\
        \ tedious and lengthy process, by both NMR and X-ray crystallography. Several\
        \ methods based on docking to study protein complexes have also been well\
        \ developed over the past few years. Most of these approaches are not driven\
        \ by experimental data but are based on a combination of energetics and shape\
        \ complementarity. Here, we present an approach called HADDOCK (High Ambiguity\
        \ Driven protein-protein Docking) that makes use of biochemical and/or biophysical\
        \ interaction data such as chemical shift perturbation data resulting from\
        \ NMR titration experiments or mutagenesis data. This information is introduced\
        \ as Ambiguous Interaction Restraints (AIRs) to drive the docking process.\
        \ An AIR is defined as an ambiguous distance between all residues shown to\
        \ be involved in the interaction. The accuracy of our approach is demonstrated\
        \ with three molecular complexes. For two of these complexes, for which both\
        \ the complex and the free protein structures have been solved, NMR titration\
        \ data were available. Mutagenesis data were used in the last example. In\
        \ all cases, the best structures generated by HADDOCK, that is, the structures\
        \ with the lowest intermolecular energies, were the closest to the published\
        \ structure of the respective complexes (within 2.0 \xC5 backbone RMSD)."
