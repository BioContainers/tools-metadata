description: Genomic variants can be analyzed and visualized using many tools. Unfortunately,
  number of tools for global interrogation of variants is limited. This package aims
  to present genomic variants (especially rare ones) in a global, per chromosome way.
  Visualization is performed in two ways - standard that outputs png figures and interactive
  that uses JavaScript d3. Interactive visualization allows to analyze trio/family
  data, for example in search for causative variants in rare Mendelian diseases.

      abstract: "\xA9 2016 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights\
        \ reserved.Motivation: The search for causative genetic variants in rare diseases\
        \ of presumed monogenic inheritance has been boosted by the implementation\
        \ of whole exome (WES) and whole genome (WGS) sequencing. In many cases, WGS\
        \ seems to be superior to WES, but the analysis and visualization of the vast\
        \ amounts of data is demanding. Results: To aid this challenge, we have developed\
        \ a new tool - RareVariantVis - for analysis of genome sequence data (including\
        \ non-coding regions) for both germ line and somatic variants. It visualizes\
        \ variants along their respective chromosomes, providing information about\
        \ exact chromosomal position, zygosity and frequency, with point-and-click\
        \ information regarding dbSNP IDs, gene association and variant inheritance.\
        \ Rare variants as well as de novo variants can be flagged in different colors.\
        \ We show the performance of the RareVariantVis tool in the Genome in a Bottle\
        \ WGS data set. Availability and implementation: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.3/bioc/html/RareVariantVis.html."
