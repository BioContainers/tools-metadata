      abstract: "For the identification and characterization of proteins harboring\
        \ posttranslational modifications (PTMs), a \"top down\" strategy using mass\
        \ spectrometry has been forwarded recently but languishes without tailored\
        \ software widely available. We describe a Web-based software and database\
        \ suite called ProSight PTM constructed for large-scale proteome projects\
        \ involving direct fragmentation of intact protein ions. Four main components\
        \ of ProSight PTM are a database retrieval algorithm (Retriever), MySQL protein\
        \ databases, a file/data manager, and a project tracker. Retriever performs\
        \ probability-based identifications from absolute fragment ion masses, automatically\
        \ compiled sequence tags, or a combination of the two, with graphical rendering\
        \ and browsing of the results. The database structure allows known and putative\
        \ protein forms to be searched, with prior or predicted PTM knowledge used\
        \ during each search. Initial functionality is illustrated with a 36-kDa yeast\
        \ protein identified from a processed cell extract after automated data acquisition\
        \ using a quadrupole-FT hybrid mass spectrometer. A +142-Da \u0394m on glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate\
        \ dehydrogenase was automatically localized between Asp90 and Asp192, consistent\
        \ with its two cystine residues (149 and 153) alkylated by acrylamide (+71\
        \ Da each) during the gel-based sample preparation. ProSight PTM is the first\
        \ search engine and Web environment for identification of intact proteins\
        \ (https://prosightptm.scs.uiuc.edu/)."
