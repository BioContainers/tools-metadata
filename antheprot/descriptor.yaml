      abstract: "Programs devoted to the analysis of protein sequences exist either\
        \ as stand-alone programs or as Web servers. However, stand-alone programs\
        \ can hardly accommodate for the analysis that involves comparisons on databanks,\
        \ which require regular updates. Moreover, Web servers cannot be as efficient\
        \ as stand-alone programs when dealing with real-time graphic display. We\
        \ describe here a stand-alone software program called ANTHEPROT, which is\
        \ intended to perform protein sequence analysis with a high integration level\
        \ and clients/server capabilities. It is an interactive program with a graphical\
        \ user interface that allows handling of protein sequence and data in a very\
        \ interactive and convenient manner. It provides many methods and tools, which\
        \ are integrated into a graphical user interface. ANTHEPROT is available for\
        \ Windows-based systems. It is able to connect to a Web server in order to\
        \ perform large-scale sequence comparison on up-to-date databanks. ANTHEPROT\
        \ is freely available to academic users and may be downloaded at http://pbil.ibcp.fr/ANTHEPROT.\
