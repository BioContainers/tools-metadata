  metadata:
    abstract: The Disease Ontology (DO) database (http:// disease-ontology.org) represents
      a comprehensive knowledge base of 8043 inherited, developmental and acquired
      human diseases (DO version 3, revision 2510). The DO web browser has been designed
      for speed, efficiency and robustness through the use of a graph database. Full-text
      contextual searching functionality using Lucene allows the querying of name,
      synonym, definition, DOID and cross-reference (xrefs) with complex Boolean search
      strings. The DO semantically integrates disease and medical vocabularies through
      extensive cross mapping and integration of MeSH, ICD, NCIâ€™s thesaurus, SNOMED
      CT and OMIM disease-specific terms and identifiers. The DO is utilized for disease
      annotation by major biomedical databases (e.g. Array Express, NIF, IEDB), as
      a standard representation of human disease in biomedical ontologies (e.g. IDO,
      Cell line ontology, NIFSTD ontology, Experimental Factor Ontology, Influenza
      Ontology), and as an ontological cross mappings resource between DO, MeSH and
      OMIM (e.g. GeneWiki). The DO project (http://diseaseontology.sf.net) has been
      incorporated into open source tools (e.g. Gene Answers, FunDO) to connect gene
      and disease biomedical data through the lens of human disease. The next iteration
      of the DO web browser will integrate DOâ€™s extended relations and logical definition
      representation along with these biomedical resource cross-mappings. © The Author(s)
