description: Highly extensible program for interactive visualization and analysis
  of molecular structures and related data, including density maps, supramolecular
  assemblies, sequence alignments, docking results, trajectories, and conformational
  ensembles. High-quality images and animations can be generated. It includes complete
  documentation and several tutorials, and can be downloaded free of charge for academic,
  government, non-profit, and personal use.

      abstract: "The design, implementation, and capabilities of an extensible visualization\
        \ system, UCSF Chimera, are discussed. Chimera is segmented into a core that\
        \ provides basic services and visualization, and extensions that provide most\
        \ higher level functionality. This architecture ensures that the extension\
        \ mechanism satisfies the demands of outside developers who wish to incorporate\
        \ new features, Two unusual extensions are presented: Multiscale, which adds\
        \ the ability to visualize large-scale molecular assemblies such as viral\
        \ coats, and Collaboratory, which allows researchers to share a Chimera session\
        \ interactively despite being at separate locales. Other extensions include\
        \ Multalign Viewer, for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated\
        \ structures; ViewDock, for screening docked ligand orientations; Movie, for\
        \ replaying molecular dynamics trajectories; and Volume Viewer, for display\
        \ and analysis of volumetric data. A discussion of the usage of Chimera in\
        \ real-world situations is given, along with anticipated future directions.\
        \ Chimera includes full user documentation, is free to academic and nonprofit\
        \ users, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, SGI\
        \ IRIX, and HP Tru64 Unix from http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/. \xA9 2004\
