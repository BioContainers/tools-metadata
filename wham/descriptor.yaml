      abstract: "Over the last decade, the cost of producing genomic sequences has\
        \ dropped dramatically due to the current so-called next-generation sequencing\
        \ methods. However, these next-generation sequencing methods are critically\
        \ dependent on fast and sophisticated data processing methods for aligning\
        \ a set of query sequences to a reference genome using rich string matching\
        \ models. The focus of this work is on the design, development and evaluation\
        \ of a data processing system for this crucial \"short read alignment\" problem.\
        \ Our system, called WHAM, employs hash-based indexing methods and bitwise\
        \ operations for sequence alignments. It allows rich match models and it is\
        \ significantly faster than the existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition,\
        \ its relative speedup over the existing method is poised to increase in the\
        \ future in which read sequence lengths will increase. \xA9 2012 ACM."
