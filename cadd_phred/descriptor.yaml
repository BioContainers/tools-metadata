      abstract: "Current methods for annotating and interpreting human genetic variation\
        \ tend to exploit a single information type (for example, conservation) and/or\
        \ are restricted in scope (for example, to missense changes). Here we describe\
        \ Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD), a method for objectively\
        \ integrating many diverse annotations into a single measure (C score) for\
        \ each variant. We implement CADD as a support vector machine trained to differentiate\
        \ 14.7 million high-frequency human-derived alleles from 14.7 million simulated\
        \ variants. We precompute C scores for all 8.6 billion possible human single-nucleotide\
        \ variants and enable scoring of short insertions-deletions. C scores correlate\
        \ with allelic diversity, annotations of functionality, pathogenicity, disease\
        \ severity, experimentally measured regulatory effects and complex trait associations,\
        \ and they highly rank known pathogenic variants within individual genomes.\
        \ The ability of CADD to prioritize functional, deleterious and pathogenic\
        \ variants across many functional categories, effect sizes and genetic architectures\
        \ is unmatched by any current single-annotation method. \xA9 2014 Nature America,\
