      abstract: "Background: Mass spectrometry based proteomics result in huge amounts\
        \ of data that has to be processed in real time in order to efficiently feed\
        \ identification algorithms and to easily integrate in automated environments.\
        \ We present wiff2dta, a tool created to convert MS/MS data obtained using\
        \ Applied Biosystem's QStar and QTrap 2000 and 4000 series. Results: Comparing\
        \ the performance of wiff2dta with the standard tools, we find wiff2dta being\
        \ the fastest solution for extracting spectrum data from ABIs raw file format.\
        \ wiff2dta is at least 10% faster than the standard tools. It is also capable\
        \ of batch processing and can be easily integrated in high throughput environments.\
        \ The program is freely available via http://www.protein-ms.de, http://sourceforge.net/projects/protms/\
        \ and is also available from Applied Biosystems. Conclusions: wiff2dta offers\
        \ the possibility to run as stand-alone application or within a batch process\
        \ as command-line tool integrated in automation and high-throughput environments.\
        \ It is more efficient than the state-of-the-art tools provided. \xA9 2004\
