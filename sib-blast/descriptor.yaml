      abstract: A SIB-BLAST web server (http://sib-blast.osc.edu) has been established
        for investigators to use the SimpleIsBeautiful (SIB) algorithm for sequence-based
        homology detection. SIB was developed to overcome the model corruption frequently
        observed in the later iterations of PSI-BLAST searches. The algorithm compares
        resultant hits from the second iteration to the final iteration of a PSI-BLAST
        search, calculates the figure of merit for each 'overlapped' hit and re-ranks
        the hits according to their figure of merit. By validating hits generated
        from the last profile against hits from the first profile when the model is
        least corrupted, the true and false positives are better delineated, which
        in turn, improves the accuracy of iterative PSI-BLAST searches. Notably, this
        improvement to PSI-BLAST comes at minimal computational cost as SIB-BLAST
        utilizes existing results already produced in a PSI-BLAST search.
