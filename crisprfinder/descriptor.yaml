    metadata:
      abstract: "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs)\
        \ constitute a particular family of tandem repeats found in a wide range of\
        \ prokaryotic genomes (half of eubacteria and almost all archaea). They consist\
        \ of a succession of highly conserved regions (DR) varying in size from 23\
        \ to 47 bp, separated by similarly sized unique sequences (spacer) of usually\
        \ viral origin. A CRISPR cluster is flanked on one side by an AT-rich sequence\
        \ called the leader and assumed to be a transcriptional promoter. Recent studies\
        \ suggest that this structure represents a putative RNA-interference-based\
        \ immune system. Here we describe CRISPRFinder, a web service offering tools\
        \ to (i) detect CRISPRs including the shortest ones (one or two motifs); (ii)\
        \ define DRs and extract spacers; (iii) get the flanking sequences to determine\
        \ the leader; (iv) blast spacers against Genbank database and (v) check if\
        \ the DR is found elsewhere in prokaryotic sequenced genomes. CRISPRFinder\
        \ is freely accessible at http://crispr.u-psud.fr/Server/CRISPRfinder.php.\
