      abstract: "Electrospray ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometers with relatively\
        \ low resolution are frequently used for the analysis of natural products\
        \ and peptides. Although ESI spectra of multiply charged protein molecules\
        \ also can be measured on this type of devices, only average spectra are produced\
        \ for the majority of naturally occurring proteins. Evaluating such ESI protein\
        \ spectra would provide valuable information about the native state of investigated\
        \ proteins. However, no suitable and freely available software could be found\
        \ which allows the charge state determination and molecular weight calculation\
        \ of single proteins from average ESI-MS data. Therefore, an algorithm based\
        \ on standard deviation optimization (scatter minimization) was implemented\
        \ for the analysis of protein ESI-MS data. The resulting software ESIprot\
        \ was tested with ESI-MS data of six intact reference proteins between 12.4\
        \ and 66.7kDa. In all cases, the correct charge states could be determined.\
        \ The obtained absolute mass errors were in a range between -0.2 and 1.2Da,\
        \ the relative errors below 30ppm. The possible mass accuracy allows for valid\
        \ conclusions about the actual condition of proteins. Moreover, the ESIprot\
        \ algorithm demonstrates an extraordinary robustness and allows spectral interpretation\
        \ from as little as two peaks, given sufficient quality of the provided m/z\
        \ data, without the necessity for peak intensity data. ESIprot is independent\
        \ from the raw data format and the computer platform, making it a versatile\
        \ tool for mass spectrometrists. The program code was released under the open-source\
        \ GPLv3 license to support future developments of mass spectrometry software.\
