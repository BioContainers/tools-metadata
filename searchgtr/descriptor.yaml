      abstract: "SEARCHGTr is a web-based software for the analysis of glycosyltransferases\
        \ (GTrs) involved in the biosynthesis of a variety of pharmaceutically important\
        \ compounds like adriamycin, erythromycin, vancomycin etc. This software has\
        \ been developed based on a comprehensive analysis of sequence/structural\
        \ features of 102 GTrs of known specificity from 52 natural product biosynthetic\
        \ gene clusters. SEARCHGTr is a powerful tool that correlates sequences of\
        \ GTrs to the chemical structures of their corresponding substrates. This\
        \ software indicates the donor/acceptor specificity and also identifies putative\
        \ substrate binding residues. In addition, it provides interfaces to other\
        \ public databases like GENBANK, SWISS-PROT, CAZY, PDB, PDBSum and PUBMED\
        \ for extracting various information on GTrs homologous to the query sequence.\
        \ SEARCHGTr would provide new dimension to our previously developed bioinformatics\
        \ tool NRPS-PKS. Together, these tools facilitate comprehensive computational\
        \ analysis of proteins involved in biosynthesis of aglycone core and its downstream\
        \ glycosylations. Apart from presenting opportunities for rational design\
        \ of novel natural products, these tools would assist in the identification\
        \ of biosynthetic products of secondary metabolite gene clusters found in\
        \ newly sequenced genomes. SEARCHGTr can be accessed at http://www.nii.res.in/\
        \ searchgtr.html. \xA9 2005 Oxford University Press."
