description: MSMS is a coalescent simulator that and permits the full range of demographic
  models provided by ms, in particular, it allows for multiple demes with arbitrary
  migration patterns, population growth and decay, and for population splits and merges.
  Applications include power studies, analytical comparisons, approximated Bayesian
  computation among others.

      abstract: "Motivation: We have implemented a coalescent simulation program for\
        \ a structured population with selection at a single diploid locus. The program\
        \ includes the functionality of the simulator ms to model population structure\
        \ and demography, but adds a model for deme-and time-dependent selection using\
        \ forward simulations. The program can be used, e.g. to study hard and soft\
        \ selective sweeps in structured populations or the genetic footprint of local\
        \ adaptation. The implementation is designed to be easily extendable and widely\
        \ deployable. The interface and output format are compatible with ms. Performance\
        \ is comparable even with selection included. \xA9 The Author(s) 2010. Published\
        \ by Oxford University Press."
