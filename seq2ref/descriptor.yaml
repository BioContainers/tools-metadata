      abstract: "Background: The size of the protein sequence database has been exponentially\
        \ increasing due to advances in genome sequencing. However, experimentally\
        \ characterized proteins only constitute a small portion of the database,\
        \ such that the majority of sequences have been annotated by computational\
        \ approaches. Current automatic annotation pipelines inevitably introduce\
        \ errors, making the annotations unreliable. Instead of such error-prone automatic\
        \ annotations, functional interpretation should rely on annotations of 'reference\
        \ proteins' that have been experimentally characterized or manually curated.Results:\
        \ The Seq2Ref server uses BLAST to detect proteins homologous to a query sequence\
        \ and identifies the reference proteins among them. Seq2Ref then reports publications\
        \ with experimental characterizations of the identified reference proteins\
        \ that might be relevant to the query. Furthermore, a plurality-based rating\
        \ system is developed to evaluate the homologous relationships and rank the\
        \ reference proteins by their relevance to the query.Conclusions: The reference\
        \ proteins detected by our server will lend insight into proteins of unknown\
        \ function and provide extensive information to develop in-depth understanding\
        \ of uncharacterized proteins. Seq2Ref is available at: http://prodata.swmed.edu/seq2ref.\
