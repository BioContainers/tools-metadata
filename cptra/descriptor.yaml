      abstract: "Background: Next-generation sequencing techniques enable several\
        \ novel transcriptome profiling approaches. Recent studies indicated that\
        \ digital gene expression profiling based on short sequence tags has superior\
        \ performance as compared to other transcriptome analysis platforms including\
        \ microarrays. However, the transcriptomic analysis with tag-based methods\
        \ often depends on available genome sequence. The use of tag-based methods\
        \ in species without genome sequence should be complemented by other methods\
        \ such as cDNA library sequencing. The combination of different next generation\
        \ sequencing techniques like 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina Genome Analyzer\
        \ (Solexa) will enable high-throughput and accurate global gene expression\
        \ profiling in species with limited genome information. The combination of\
        \ transcriptome data acquisition methods requires cross-platform transcriptome\
        \ data analysis platforms, including a new software package for data processing.\
        \ Results: Here we presented a software package, CPTRA: Cross-Platform TRanscriptome\
        \ Analysis, to analyze transcriptome profiling data from separate methods.\
        \ The software package is available at http://people.tamu.edu/~syuan/cptra/cptra.html.\
        \ It was applied to the case study of non-target site glyphosate resistance\
        \ in horseweed; and the data was mined to discover resistance target gene(s).\
        \ For the software, the input data included a long-read sequence dataset with\
        \ proper annotation, and a short-read sequence tag dataset for the quantification\
        \ of transcripts. By combining the two datasets, the software carries out\
        \ the unique sequence tag identification, tag counting for transcript quantification,\
        \ and cross-platform sequence matching functions, whereby the short sequence\
        \ tags can be annotated with a function, level of expression, and Gene Ontology\
        \ (GO) classification. Multiple sequence search algorithms were implemented\
        \ and compared. The analysis highlighted the importance of transport genes\
        \ in glyphosate resistance and identified several candidate genes for down-stream\
        \ analysis. Conclusion: CPTRA is a powerful software package for next generation\
        \ sequencing-based transcriptome profiling in species with limited genome\
        \ information. According to our case study, the strategy can greatly broaden\
        \ the application of the next generation sequencing for transcriptome analysis\
        \ in species without reference genome sequence. \xA9 2009 Zhou et al; licensee\
