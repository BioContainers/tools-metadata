description: A tool for analysis of normalisation effects on quantitative omics data
  and for subsequent differential expression analysis. The tool provides multiple
  normalisation methods and access to different statistical tests and generates reports
  and data matrices

      abstract: "Copyright \xA9 2018 American Chemical Society. Technical biases are\
        \ introduced in omics data sets during data generation and interfere with\
        \ the ability to study biological mechanisms. Several normalization approaches\
        \ have been proposed to minimize the effects of such biases, but fluctuations\
        \ in the electrospray current during liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry\
        \ gradients cause local and sample-specific bias not considered by most approaches.\
        \ Here we introduce a software named NormalyzerDE that includes a generic\
        \ retention time (RT)-segmented approach compatible with a wide range of global\
        \ normalization approaches to reduce the effects of time-resolved bias. The\
        \ software offers straightforward access to multiple normalization methods,\
        \ allows for data set evaluation and normalization quality assessment as well\
        \ as subsequent or independent differential expression analysis using the\
        \ empirical Bayes Limma approach. When evaluated on two spike-in data sets\
        \ the RT-segmented approaches outperformed conventional approaches by detecting\
        \ more peptides (8-36%) without loss of precision. Furthermore, differential\
        \ expression analysis using the Limma approach consistently increased recall\
        \ (2-35%) compared to analysis of variance. The combination of RT-normalization\
        \ and Limma was in one case able to distinguish 108% (2597 vs 1249) more spike-in\
        \ peptides compared to traditional approaches. NormalyzerDE provides widely\
        \ usable tools for performing normalization and evaluating the outcome and\
        \ makes calculation of subsequent differential expression statistics straightforward.\
        \ The program is available as a web server at http://quantitativeproteomics.org/normalyzerde."
