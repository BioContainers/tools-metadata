      abstract: "Proteomics strategies based on nanoflow (nano-) LC-MS/MS allow the\
        \ identification of hundreds to thousands of proteins in complex mixtures.\
        \ When combined with protein isotopic labeling, quantitative comparison of\
        \ the proteome from different samples can be achieved using these approaches.\
        \ However, bioinformatics analysis of the data remains a bottleneck in large\
        \ scale quantitative proteomics studies. Here we present a new software named\
        \ Mascot File Parsing and Quantification (MFPaQ) that easily processes the\
        \ results of the Mascot search engine and performs protein quantification\
        \ in the case of isotopic labeling experiments using either the ICAT or SILAC\
        \ (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) method. This\
        \ new tool provides a convenient interface to retrieve Mascot protein lists;\
        \ sort them according to Mascot scoring or to user-defined criteria based\
        \ on the number, the score, and the rank of identified peptides; and to validate\
        \ the results. Moreover the software extracts quantitative data from raw files\
        \ obtained by nano-LC-MS/MS, calculates peptide ratios, and generates a non-redundant\
        \ list of proteins identified in a multisearch experiment with their calculated\
        \ averaged and normalized ratio. Here we apply this software to the proteornics\
        \ analysis of membrane proteins from primary human endothelial cells (ECs),\
        \ a cell type involved in many physiological and pathological processes including\
        \ chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. We analyzed\
        \ the EC membrane proteome and set up methods for quantitative analysis of\
        \ this proteome by ICAT labeling. EC microsomal proteins were fractionated\
        \ and analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS, and database searches were performed with\
        \ Mascot. Data validation and clustering of proteins were performed with MFPaQ,\
        \ which allowed identification of more than 600 unique proteins. The software\
        \ was also successfully used in a quantitative differential proteomics analysis\
        \ of the EC membrane proteome after stimulation with a combination of proinflammatory\
        \ mediators (tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1, interferon-\u03B3, and lymphotoxin\
        \ \u03B1/\u03B2) that resulted in the identification of a full spectrum of\
        \ EC membrane proteins regulated by inflammation. \xA9 2007 by The American\
