      abstract: "When routinely analysing very long stretches of DNA sequences produced\
        \ by genome sequencing projects, detailed analysis of database search results\
        \ becomes exceedingly time consuming. To reduce the tedious browsing of large\
        \ quantities of protein similarities, two programs, MSPcrunch and Blixem,\
        \ were developed, which assist in processing the results from the database\
        \ search programs in the BLAST suite. MSPcrunch removes biased composition\
        \ and redundant matches while keeping weak matches that are consistent with\
        \ a larger gapped alignment. This makes BLASTsearching in practice more sensitive\
        \ and reduces the risk of overlooking distant similarities. Blixem is a multiple\
        \ sequence alignment viewer for X-windows which makes it significantly easier\
        \ to scan and evaluate the matches ratified by MSPcrunch. In Blixem, matches\
        \ to the translated DNA query sequence are simultaneously aligned in three\
        \ frames. Also, the distribution of matches over the whole DNA query is displayed.\
        \ Examples of usage are drawn from 36 C.elegans cosmid clones totalling 1.2\
        \ megabases, to which these tools were applied. \xA9 1994 Oxford University\
