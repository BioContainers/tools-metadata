      abstract: "We present ALICO (ALIgnment COnstrainted) null set generator: a framework\
        \ to generate randomized versions of an input multiple sequence alignment\
        \ that preserve some of its crucial features including its dependence structure.\
        \ In particular, we show that, on average, ALICO samples approximately preserve\
        \ the PIDs (percent identities) between every pair of input sequences. At\
        \ the same time our examples demonstrate that the average k-mer composition\
        \ of each of the sampled sequences show great resemblance to the k-mer composition\
        \ of our genomic training data. Of note is that ALICO requires only pairwise\
        \ alignment training data rather than multiple alignment training data. We\
        \ demonstrate the utility of ALICO in predicting the correct results returned\
        \ by the \"homology- aware\" finders PhyloCon, MEME with conservation prior\
        \ and PRIORITY-C, as well as by our \"naive\" finder GibbsMarkov, applied\
        \ to the MacIsaac orthologous yeast data. Finally, we show that using ALICO\
        \ sampling derived p-values to combine results from multiple finders often\
        \ outperforms its best individual component. Supplementary Material is available\
