      abstract: "MassMatrix is a program that matches tandem mass spectra with theoretical\
        \ peptide sequences derived from a protein database. The program uses a mass\
        \ accuracy sensitive probabilistic score model to rank peptide matches. The\
        \ MS/MS search software was evaluated by use of a high mass accuracy dataset\
        \ and its results compared with those from MASCOT, SEQUEST, X!Tandem, and\
        \ OMSSA. For the high mass accuracy data, MassMatrix provided better sensitivity\
        \ than MASCOT, SEQUEST, X!Tandem, and OMSSA for a given specificity and the\
        \ percentage of false positives was 2%. More importantly all manually validated\
        \ true positives corresponded to a unique peptide/spectrum match. The presence\
        \ of decoy sequence and additional variable PTMs did not significantly affect\
        \ the results from the high mass accuracy search. MassMatrix performs well\
        \ when compared with MASCOT, SEQUEST, X!Tandem, and OMSSA with regard to search\
        \ time. MassMatrix was also run on a distributed memory clusters and achieved\
        \ search speeds of \u223C100 000 spectra per hour when searching against a\
        \ complete human database with eight variable modifications. The algorithm\
        \ is available for public searches at http://www.massmatrix.net. \xA9 2009\
