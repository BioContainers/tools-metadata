      abstract: "\xA9 2015 The Author(s). The identification of the molecular pathways\
        \ active in specific contexts, such as disease states or drug responses, often\
        \ requires an extensive view of the potential interactions between a subset\
        \ of proteins. This view is not easily obtained: it requires the integration\
        \ of context-specific protein list or expression data with up-to-date data\
        \ of protein interactions that are typically spread across multiple databases.\
        \ The MyProteinNet web server allows users to easily create such context-sensitive\
        \ protein interaction networks. Users can automatically gather and consolidate\
        \ data from up to 11 different databases to create a generic protein interaction\
        \ network (interactome). They can score the interactions based on reliability\
        \ and filter them by user-defined contexts including molecular expression\
        \ and protein annotation. The output of MyProteinNet includes the generic\
        \ and filtered interactome files, together with a summary of their network\
        \ attributes. MyProteinNet is particularly geared toward building human tissue\
        \ interactomes, by maintaining tissue expression profiles from multiple resources.\
        \ The ability of MyProteinNet to facilitate the construction of up-to-date,\
        \ context-specific interactomes and its applicability to 11 different organisms\
        \ and to tens of human tissues, make it a powerful tool in meaningful analysis\
        \ of protein networks. MyProteinNet is available at http://netbio.bgu.ac.il/myproteinnet."
