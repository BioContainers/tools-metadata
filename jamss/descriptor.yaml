      abstract: "\xA9 The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights\
        \ reserved.Countless proteomics data processing algorithms have been proposed,\
        \ yet few have been critically evaluated due to lack of labeled data (data\
        \ with known identities and quantities). Although labeling techniques exist,\
        \ they are limited in terms of confidence and accuracy. In silico simulators\
        \ have recently been used to create complex data with known identities and\
        \ quantities. We propose Java Mass Spectrometry Simulator (JAMSS): a fast,\
        \ self-contained in silico simulator capable of generating simulated MS and\
        \ LC-MS runs while providing meta information on the provenance of each generated\
        \ signal. JAMSS improves upon previous in silico simulators in terms of its\
        \ ease to install, minimal parameters, graphical user interface, multithreading\
        \ capability, retention time shift model and reproducibility."
