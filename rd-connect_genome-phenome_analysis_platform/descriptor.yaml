      abstract: "Research into rare diseases is typically fragmented by data type\
        \ and disease. Individual efforts often have poor interoperability and do\
        \ not systematically connect data across clinical phenotype, genomic data,\
        \ biomaterial availability, and research/trial data sets. Such data must be\
        \ linked at both an individual-patient and whole-cohort level to enable researchers\
        \ to gain a complete view of their disease and patient population of interest.\
        \ Data access and authorization procedures are required to allow researchers\
        \ in multiple institutions to securely compare results and gain new insights.\
        \ Funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under the International\
        \ Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC), RD-Connect is a global infrastructure\
        \ project initiated in November 2012 that links genomic data with registries,\
        \ biobanks, and clinical bioinformatics tools to produce a central research\
        \ resource for rare diseases. \xA9 2014 Society of General Internal Medicine."
