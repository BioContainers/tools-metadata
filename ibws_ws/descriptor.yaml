      abstract: "The Bioinformatics group at the National Cancer Research Institute\
        \ (IST) of Genoa has been involved since many years in the development and\
        \ maintenance of biomedical information systems. Among them, the Common Access\
        \ to Biological Resources and Information network services offer access to\
        \ more than 130 000 biological resources, like strains of micro-organisms\
        \ and human and animal cell lines, included in 29 collections from some of\
        \ the most known European Biological Resource Centers. An Sequence Retrieval\
        \ System (SRS) implementation of the TP53 Mutation Database of the International\
        \ Agency for Research on Cancer (Lyon) was made available in order to improve\
        \ interoperability of this data with other molecular biology databases. 'SRS\
        \ by WS (SWS)', a system for retrieving information on public SRS sites and\
        \ for directly querying them, was also implemented. In order to make this\
        \ information available through application programming interfaces, we implemented\
        \ a suite of free web services (WS), called the 'IST Bioinformatics Web Services\
        \ (IBWS)'. A support web site, including a description of the system, a list\
        \ of available WS together with help pages, links to corresponding WSDLs and\
        \ forms for testing services, is available at http://bioinfor matics.istge.it/ibws/.\
        \ WSDL definitions can also be retrieved directly at http://bioinformatics.istge.it:8080/axis/services.\
