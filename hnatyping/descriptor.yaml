      abstract: "Background: Neutrophil antigens are involved in a variety of clinical\
        \ conditions including transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and other\
        \ transfusion-related diseases. Recently, there are five characterized groups\
        \ of human neutrophil antigen (HNA) systems, the HNA1 to 5. Characterization\
        \ of all neutrophil antigens from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data may be\
        \ accomplished for revealing complete genotyping formats of neutrophil antigens\
        \ collectively at genome level with molecular variations which may respectively\
        \ be revealed with available genotyping techniques for neutrophil antigens\
        \ conventionally. Results: We developed a computing method for the genotyping\
        \ of human neutrophil antigens. Six samples from two families, available from\
        \ the 1000 Genomes projects, were used for a HNA typing test. There are 500\
        \ \u223C 3000 reads per sample filtered from the adopted human WGS datasets\
        \ in order for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of neutrophil\
        \ antigens. The visualization of read alignment shows that the yield reads\
        \ from WGS dataset are enough to cover all of the SNP loci for the antigen\
        \ system: HNA1, HNA3, HNA4 and HNA5. Consequently, our implemented Bioinformatics\
        \ tool successfully revealed HNA types on all of the six samples including\
        \ sequence-based typing (SBT) as well as PCR sequence-specific oligonucleotide\
        \ probes (SSOP), PCR sequence-specific primers (SSP) and PCR restriction fragment\
        \ length polymorphism (RFLP) along with parentage possibility. Conclusions:\
        \ The next-generation sequencing technology strives to deliver affordable\
        \ and non-biased sequencing results, hence the complete genotyping formats\
        \ of HNA may be reported collectively from mining the output data of WGS.\
        \ The study shows the feasibility of HNA genotyping through new WGS technologies.\
        \ Our proposed algorithmic methodology is implemented in a HNATyping software\
        \ package with user's guide available to the public at. \xA9 2013 Chu et al.;\
