      abstract: "\xA9 2015 American Chemical Society.In the past decade, proteogenomics\
        \ has emerged as a valuable technique that contributes to the state-of-the-art\
        \ in genome annotation; however, previous proteogenomic studies were limited\
        \ to bottom-up mass spectrometry and did not take advantage of top-down approaches.\
        \ We show that top-down proteogenomics allows one to address the problems\
        \ that remained beyond the reach of traditional bottom-up proteogenomics.\
        \ In particular, we show that top-down proteogenomics leads to the discovery\
        \ of previously unannotated genes even in extensively studied bacterial genomes\
        \ and present SpectroGene, a software tool for genome annotation using top-down\
        \ tandem mass spectra. We further show that top-down proteogenomics searches\
        \ (against the six-frame translation of a genome) identify nearly all proteoforms\
        \ found in traditional top-down proteomics searches (against the annotated\
        \ proteome). SpectroGene is freely available at http://github.com/fenderglass/SpectroGene."
