      abstract: "\xA9 2014 Golosova et al.The advent of Next Generation Sequencing\
        \ (NGS) technologies has opened new possibilities for researchers. However,\
        \ the more biology becomes a data-intensive field, the more biologists have\
        \ to learn how to process and analyze NGS data with complex computational\
        \ tools. Even with the availability of common pipeline specifications, it\
        \ is often a time-consuming and cumbersome task for a bench scientist to install\
        \ and configure the pipeline tools. We believe that a unified, desktop and\
        \ biologist-friendly front end to NGS data analysis tools will substantially\
        \ improve productivity in this field. Here we present NGS pipelines \"Variant\
        \ Calling with SAMtools\", \"Tuxedo Pipeline for RNA-seq Data Analysis\" and\
        \ \"Cistrome Pipeline for ChIP-seq Data Analysis\" integrated into the Unipro\
        \ UGENE desktop toolkit. We describe the available UGENE infrastructure that\
        \ helps researchers run these pipelines on different datasets, store and investigate\
        \ the results and re-run the pipelines with the same parameters. These pipeline\
        \ tools are included in the UGENE NGS package. Individual blocks of these\
        \ pipelines are also available for expert users to create their own advanced\
        \ workflows."
