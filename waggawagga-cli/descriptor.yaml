        \ under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits\
        \ unrestricted use, distribution, and eproduction in any medium, provided\
        \ the original author and source are credited. Stable single-Alpha helices\
        \ (SAH-domains) function as rigid connectors and constant force springs between\
        \ structural domains, and can provide contact surfaces for protein-protein\
        \ and protein-RNA interactions. SAH-domains mainly consist of charged amino\
        \ acids and are monomeric and stable in polar solutions, characteristics which\
        \ distinguish them from coiledcoil domains and intrinsically disordered regions.\
        \ Although the number of reported SAHdomains is steadily increasing, genome-wide\
        \ analyses of SAH-domains in eukaryotic genomes are still missing. Here, we\
        \ present Waggawagga-CLI, a command-line tool for predicting and analysing\
        \ SAH-domains in protein sequence datasets. Using Waggawagga-CLI we predicted\
        \ SAH-domains in 24 datasets from eukaryotes across the tree of life. SAHdomains\
        \ were predicted in 0.5 to 3.5% of the protein-coding content per species.\
        \ SAHdomains are particularly present in longer proteins supporting their\
        \ function as structural building block in multi-domain proteins. In human,\
        \ SAH-domains are mainly used as alternative building blocks not being present\
        \ in all transcripts of a gene. Gene ontology analysis showed that yeast proteins\
        \ with SAH-domains are particular enriched in macromolecular complex subunit\
        \ organization, cellular component biogenesis and RNA metabolic processes,\
        \ and that they have a strong nuclear and ribonucleoprotein complex localization\
        \ and function in ribosome and nucleic acid binding. Human proteins with SAH-domains\
        \ have roles in all types of RNA processing and cytoskeleton organization,\
        \ and are predicted to function in RNA binding, protein binding involved in\
        \ cell and cell-cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal protein binding. Waggawagga-CLI\
        \ allows the user to adjust the stabilizing and destabilizing contribution\
        \ of amino acid interactions in i,i+3 and i,i+4 spacings, and provides extensive\
        \ flexibility for user-designed analyses."
