description: Genomics England PanelApp is a publically-available knowledgebase that
  allows virtual gene panels related to human disorders to be created, stored and
  queried. It includes a crowdsourcing tool that allows genes to be added or reviewed
  by experts throughout the worldwide scientific community, providing an opportunity
  for the standardisation of gene panels, and a consensus on which genes have sufficient
  evidence for disease association.
