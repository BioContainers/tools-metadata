      abstract: The ability to separate correct models of protein structures from
        less correct models is of the greatest importance for protein structure prediction
        methods. Several studies have examined the ability of different types of energy
        function to detect the native, or native-like, protein structure from a large
        set of decoys. In contrast to earlier studies, we examine here the ability
        to detect models that only show limited structural similarity to the native
        structure. These correct models are defined by the existence of a fragment
        that shows significant similarity between this model and the native structure.
        It has been shown that the existence of such fragments is useful for comparing
        the performance between different fold recognition methods and that this performance
        correlates well with performance in fold recognition. We have developed ProQ,
        a neural-network-based method to predict the quality of a protein model that
        extracts structural features, such as frequency of atom-atom contacts, and
        predicts the quality of a model, as measured either by LGscore or MaxSub.
        We show that ProQ performs at least as well as other measures when identifying
        the native structure and is better at the detection of correct models. This
        performance is maintained over several different test sets. ProQ can also
        be combined with the Pcons fold recognition predictor (Pmodeller) to increase
        its performance, with the main advantage being the elimination of a few high-scoring
        incorrect models. Pmodeller was successful in CASP5 and results from the latest
        LiveBench, LiveBench-6, indicating that Pmodeller has a higher specificity
        than Pcons alone.
