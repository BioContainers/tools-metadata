      abstract: "\xA9 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on\
        \ behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. Complex carbohydrates of plants are the\
        \ main food sources of animals and microbes, and serve as promising renewable\
        \ feedstock for biofuel and biomaterial production. Carbohydrate active enzymes\
        \ (CAZymes) are the most important enzymes for complex carbohydrate metabolism.\
        \ With an increasing number of plant and plant-associated microbial genomes\
        \ and metagenomes being sequenced, there is an urgent need of automatic tools\
        \ for genomic data mining of CAZymes. We developed the dbCAN web server in\
        \ 2012 to provide a public service for automated CAZyme annotation for newly\
        \ sequenced genomes. Here, dbCAN2 (http://cys.bios.niu.edu/dbCAN2) is presented\
        \ as an updated meta server, which integrates three state-of-the-art tools\
        \ for CAZome (all CAZymes of a genome) annotation: (i) HMMER search against\
        \ the dbCAN HMM (hidden Markov model) database; (ii) DIAMOND search against\
        \ the CAZy pre-annotated CAZyme sequence database and (iii) Hotpep search\
        \ against the conserved CAZyme short peptide database. Combining the three\
        \ outputs and removing CAZymes found by only one tool can significantly improve\
        \ the CAZome annotation accuracy. In addition, dbCAN2 now also accepts nucleotide\
        \ sequence submission, and offers the service to predict physically linked\
        \ CAZyme gene clusters (CGCs), which will be a very useful online tool for\
        \ identifying putative polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) in microbial\
        \ genomes or metagenomes."
