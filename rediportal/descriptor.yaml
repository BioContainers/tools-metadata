      abstract: "\xA9 2016 The Author(s). RNA editing by A-to-I deamination is the\
        \ prominent co-/post-transcriptional modification in humans. It is carried\
        \ out by ADAR enzymes and contributes to both transcriptomic and proteomic\
        \ expansion. RNA editing has pivotal cellular effects and its deregulation\
        \ has been linked to a variety of human disorders including neurological and\
        \ neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Despite its biological relevance,\
        \ many physiological and functional aspects of RNA editing are yet elusive.\
        \ Here, we present REDIportal, available online at http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/,\
        \ the largest and comprehensive collection of RNA editing in humans including\
        \ more than 4.5 millions of A-to-I events detected in 55 body sites from thousands\
        \ of RNAseq experiments. REDIportal embeds RADAR database and represents the\
        \ first editing resource designed to answer functional questions, enabling\
        \ the inspection and browsing of editing levels in a variety of human samples,\
        \ tissues and body sites. In contrast with previous RNA editing databases,\
        \ REDIportal comprises its own browser (JBrowse) that allows users to explore\
        \ A-to-I changes in their genomic context, empathizing repetitive elements\
        \ in which RNA editing is prominent."
