      abstract: "This paper presents a novel approach to profile-profile comparison.\
        \ The method compares two input profiles (like those that are generated by\
        \ PSI-BLAST) and assigns a similarity score to assess their statistical similarity.\
        \ Our profile-profile comparison tool, which allows for gaps, can be used\
        \ to detect weak similarities between protein families. It has also been optimized\
        \ to produce alignments that are in very good agreement with structural alignments.\
        \ Tests show that the profile-profile alignments are indeed highly correlated\
        \ with similarities between secondary structure elements and tertiary structure.\
        \ Exhaustive evaluations show that our method is significantly more sensitive\
        \ in detecting distant homologies than the popular profile-based search programs\
        \ PSI-BLAST and IMPALA. The relative improvement is the same order of magnitude\
        \ as the improvement of PSI-BLAST relative to BLAST. Our new tool often detects\
        \ similarities that fall within the twilight zone of sequence similarity.\
