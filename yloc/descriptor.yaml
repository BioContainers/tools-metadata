      abstract: "Predicting subcellular localization has become a valuable alternative\
        \ to time-consuming experimental methods. Major drawbacks of many of these\
        \ predictors is their lack of interpretability and the fact that they do not\
        \ provide an estimate of the confidence of an individual prediction. We present\
        \ YLoc, an interpretable web server for predicting subcellular localization.\
        \ YLoc uses natural language to explain why a prediction was made and which\
        \ biological property of the protein was mainly responsible for it. In addition,\
        \ YLoc estimates the reliability of its own predictions. YLoc can, thus, assist\
        \ in understanding protein localization and in location engineering of proteins.\
        \ The YLoc web server is available online at www.multiloc.org/YLoc. \xA9 The\
        \ Author(s) 2010. Published by Oxford University Press."
