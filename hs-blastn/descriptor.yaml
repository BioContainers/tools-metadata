      abstract: "\xA9 2015 The Author(s). Sequence alignment is a long standing problem\
        \ in bioinformatics. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is one\
        \ of the most popular and fundamental alignment tools. The explosive growth\
        \ of biological sequences calls for speedup of sequence alignment tools such\
        \ as BLAST. To this end, we develop high speed BLASTN (HS-BLASTN), a parallel\
        \ and fast nucleotide database search tool that accelerates MegaBLAST-the\
        \ default module of NCBIBLASTN. HS-BLASTN builds a new lookup table using\
        \ the FMD-index of the database and employs an accurate and effective seeding\
        \ method to find short stretches of identities (called seeds) between the\
        \ query and the database. HS-BLASTN produces the same alignment results as\
        \ MegaBLAST and its computational speed is much faster than MegaBLAST. Specifically,\
        \ our experiments conducted on a 12-core server show that HS-BLASTN can be\
        \ 22 times faster than MegaBLAST and exhibits better parallel performance\
        \ than MegaBLAST. HS-BLASTN is written in C++ and the related source code\
        \ is available at https://github.com/chenying2016/queries under the GPLv3\
        \ license."
