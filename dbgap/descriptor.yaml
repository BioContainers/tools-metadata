description: The Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes is a National Institutes of
  Health-sponsored repository charged to archive and distribute the data and results
  from studies that have investigated the interaction of genotype and phenotype in
  humans. Information in dbGaP is organized as a hierarchical structure and includes
  the accessioned objects, phenotypes (as variables and datasets), various molecular
  assay data (SNP and Expression Array data, Sequence and Epigenomic marks), analyses
  and documents.
