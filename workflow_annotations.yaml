    name: nf-core/eager
    description: nf-core/eager is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for NGS sequencing based ancient DNA (aDNA) data analysis. The pipeline uses Nextflow, a bioinformatics workflow tool. It pre-processes raw data from FASTQ inputs, or preprocessed BAM inputs. It can align reads and performs extensive general NGS and aDNA specific quality-control on the results. It comes with docker, singularity or conda containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.
