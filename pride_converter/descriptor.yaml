      abstract: "Protein kinase signaling is fundamental to cell homeostasis and is\
        \ deregulated in all cancers but varies between patients. Understanding the\
        \ mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity is critical for personalized targeted\
        \ therapies. Here, we used a recently established LC-MS/MS platform to profile\
        \ protein phosphorylation in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines with different\
        \ sensitivities to kinase inhibitors. The compounds used in this study were\
        \ originally developed to target Janus kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,\
        \ and MEK. After further validation of the technique, we identified several\
        \ phosphorylation sites that were inhibited by these compounds but whose intensities\
        \ did not always correlate with growth inhibition sensitivity. In contrast,\
        \ several hundred phosphorylation sites that correlated with sensitivity/resistance\
        \ were not in general inhibited by the compounds. These results indicate that\
        \ markers of pathway activity may not always be reliable indicators of sensitivity\
        \ of cancer cells to inhibitors that target such pathways, because the activity\
        \ of parallel kinases can contribute to resistance. By mining our data we\
        \ identified protein kinase C isoforms as one of such parallel pathways being\
        \ more active in resistant cells. Consistent with the view that several parallel\
        \ kinase pathways were contributing to resistance, inhibitors that target\
        \ protein kinase C, MEK, and Janus kinase potentiated each other in arresting\
        \ the proliferation of multidrug-resistant cells. Untargeted/unbiased approaches,\
        \ such as the one described here, to quantify the activity of the intended\
        \ target kinase pathway in concert with the activities of parallel kinase\
        \ pathways will be invaluable to personalize therapies based on kinase inhibitors.\
