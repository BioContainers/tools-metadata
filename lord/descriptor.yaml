      abstract: Characterizing a rare disease diagnosis for a given patient is often
        made through expert's networks. It is a complex task that could evolve over
        time depending on the natural history of the disease and the evolution of
        the scientific knowledge. Most rare diseases have genetic causes and recent
        improvements of sequencing techniques contribute to the discovery of many
        new diseases every year. Diagnosis coding in the rare disease field requires
        data from multiple knowledge bases to be aggregated in order to offer the
        clinician a global information space from possible diagnosis to clinical signs
        (phenotypes) and known genetic mutations (genotype). Nowadays, the major barrier
        to the coding activity is the lack of consolidation of such information scattered
        in different thesaurus such as Orphanet, OMIM or HPO. The Linking Open data
        for Rare Diseases (LORD) web portal we developed stands as the first attempt
        to fill this gap by offering an integrated view of 8,400 rare diseases linked
        to more than 14,500 signs and 3,270 genes. The application provides a browsing
        feature to navigate through the relationships between diseases, signs and
        genes, and some Application Programming Interfaces to help its integration
        in health information systems in routine.
