    abstract: © The Author(s) 2017. The detection of orthologs is a key approach in
      genomics, useful to understand gene evolution and phylogenetic relationships
      and essential for gene function prediction. However, a reliable annotation of
      the encoded protein regions is still a limiting aspect in genomics, mainly due
      to the lack of confirmatory experimental evidence at proteome level. Nevertheless,
      the current ortholog collections are generally based on protein sequence comparisons,
      in addition to the availability of large transcriptome sequence collections.
      We developed Transcriptologs, a method for the prediction of orthologs based
      on similarities of translated fragments from messenger RNAs of 2 species. We
      implemented a procedure to extend BLAST-based alignments and to define orthologs
      based on the Bidirectional Best Hit approach. Results from a test case on Arabidopsis
      thaliana and Sorghum bicolor transcript collections revealed in some cases outperformance
      of Transcriptologs in comparison with a classical protein-based analysis in
      terms of alignment quality, revealing similarities otherwise not detectable.
