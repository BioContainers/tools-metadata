description: A new method for searching Non-Coding RNAs in databases. The strategy
  we adopted relies on the use of the mutual information embedded in di-nucleotides.
  We have shown that this approach has better sensitivity and specifity than other
  softwares with comparable computational cost.

      abstract: "We present and validate BlastR, a method for efficiently and accurately\
        \ searching non-coding RNAs. Our approach relies on the comparison of di-nucleotides\
        \ using BlosumR, a new log-odd substitution matrix. In order to use BlosumR\
        \ for comparison, we recoded RNA sequences into protein-like sequences. We\
        \ then showed that BlosumR can be used along with the BlastP algorithm in\
        \ order to search non-coding RNA sequences. Using Rfam as a gold standard,\
        \ we benchmarked this approach and show BlastR to be more sensitive than BlastN.\
        \ We also show that BlastR is both faster and more sensitive than BlastP used\
        \ with a single nucleotide log-odd substitution matrix. BlastR, when used\
        \ in combination with WU-BlastP, is about 5 more accurate than WU-BlastN and\
        \ about 50 times slower. The approach shown here is equally effective when\
        \ combined with the NCBI-Blast package. The software is an open source freeware\
        \ available from www.tcoffee.org/blastr.html. \xA9 2011 The Author(s)."
