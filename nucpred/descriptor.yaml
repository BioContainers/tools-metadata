      abstract: "Summary: NucPred analyzes patterns in eukaryotic protein sequences\
        \ and predicts if a protein spends at least some time in the nucleus or no\
        \ time at all. Subcellular location of proteins represents functional information,\
        \ which is important for understanding protein interactions, for the diagnosis\
        \ of human diseases and for drug discovery. NucPred is a novel web tool based\
        \ on regular expression matching and multiple program classifiers induced\
        \ by genetic programming. A likelihood score is derived from the programs\
        \ for each input sequence and each residue position. Different forms of visualization\
        \ are provided to assist the detection of nuclear localization signals (NLSs).\
        \ The NucPred server also provides access to additional sources of biological\
        \ information (real and predicted) for a better validation and interpretation\
        \ of results. \xA9 The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press.\
