      abstract: Domain combination provides important clues to the roles of protein
        domains in protein function, interaction and evolution. We have developed
        a web server d-Omix (a Mixer of Protein Domain Analysis Tools) aiming as a
        unified platform to analyze, compare and visualize protein data sets in various
        aspects of protein domain combinations. With InterProScan files for protein
        sets of interest provided by users, the server incorporates four services
        for domain analyses. First, it constructs protein phylogenetic tree based
        on a distance matrix calculated from protein domain architectures (DAs), allowing
        the comparison with a sequence-based tree. Second, it calculates and visualizes
        the versatility, abundance and co-presence of protein domains via a domain
        graph. Third, it compares the similarity of proteins based on DA alignment.
        Fourth, it builds a putative protein network derived from domain-domain interactions
        from DOMINE. Users may select a variety of input data files and flexibly choose
        domain search tools (e.g. hmmpfam, superfamily) for a specific analysis. Results
        from the d-Omix could be interactively explored and exported into various
        formats such as SVG, JPG, BMP and CSV. Users with only protein sequences could
        prepare an InterProScan file using a service provided by the server as well.
        The d-Omix web server is freely available at http://www.biotec.or.th/isl/Domix.
