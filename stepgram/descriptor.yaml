      abstract: "DNA amplifications and deletions characterize cancer genome and are\
        \ often related to disease evolution. Microarray-based techniques for measuring\
        \ these DNA copy-number changes use fluorescence ratios at arrayed DNA elements\
        \ (BACs, cDNA, or oligonucleotides) to provide signals at high resolution,\
        \ in terms of genomic locations. These date are then further analyzed to map\
        \ aberrations and boundaries and identify biologically significant structures.\
        \ We develop a statistical framework that enables the casting of several DNA\
        \ copy number data analysis questions as optimization problems over real-valued\
        \ vectors of signals. The simplest form of the optimization problem seeks\
        \ to maximize \u03C6(I) = \u03A3vi/\u221A|I| over all subintervals I in the\
        \ input vector. We present and prove a linear time approximation scheme for\
        \ this problem, namely, a process with time complexity O (n\u03B5-2) that\
        \ outputs an interval for which \u03C6(I) is at least Opt/\u03B1(\u03B5),\
        \ where Opt is the actual optimum and \u03B1(\u03B5) \u2192 1 as \u03B5 \u2192\
        \ 0. We further develop practical implementations that improve the performance\
        \ of the naive quadratic approach by orders of magnitude. We discuss properties\
        \ of optimal intervals and how they apply to the algorithm performance. We\
        \ benchmark our algorithms on synthetic as well as publicly available DNA\
        \ copy number data. We demonstrate the use of these methods for identifying\
        \ aberrations in single samples as well as common alterations in fixed sets\
        \ and subsets of breast cancer samples. \xA9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."
