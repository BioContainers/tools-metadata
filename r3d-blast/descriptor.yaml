description: BLAST-like search tool that allows users to quickly search against the
  PDB for RNA structures sharing similar substructures with a specified query RNA
  structure. Input is an RNA 3D structure in PDB format, output includes a graphical
  display showing structural superposition.

    metadata:
      abstract: "R3D-BLAST is a BLAST-like search tool that allows the user to quickly\
        \ and accurately search against the PDB for RNA structures sharing similar\
        \ substructures with a specified query RNA structure. The basic idea behind\
        \ R3D-BLAST is that all the RNA 3D structures deposited in the PDB are first\
        \ encoded as 1D structural sequences using a structural alphabet of 23 distinct\
        \ nucleotide conformations, and BLAST is then applied to these 1D structural\
        \ sequences to search for those RNA substructures whose 1D structural sequences\
        \ are similar to that of the query RNA substructure. R3D-BLAST takes as input\
        \ an RNA 3D structure in the PDB format and outputs all substructures of the\
        \ hits similar to that of the query with a graphical display to show their\
        \ structural superposition. In addition, each RNA substructure hit found by\
        \ R3D-BLAST has an associated E-value to measure its statistical significance.\
        \ R3D-BLAST is now available online at http://genome.cs.nthu.edu.tw/R3D-BLAST/\
        \ for public access. \xA9 2011 The Author(s)."
