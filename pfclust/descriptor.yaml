      abstract: "Background: We present the algorithm PFClust (Parameter Free Clustering),\
        \ which is able automatically to cluster data and identify a suitable number\
        \ of clusters to group them into without requiring any parameters to be specified\
        \ by the user. The algorithm partitions a dataset into a number of clusters\
        \ that share some common attributes, such as their minimum expectation value\
        \ and variance of intra-cluster similarity. A set of n objects can be clustered\
        \ into any number of clusters from one to n, and there are many different\
        \ hierarchical and partitional, agglomerative and divisive, clustering methodologies\
        \ available that can be used to do this. Nonetheless, automatically determining\
        \ the number of clusters present in a dataset constitutes a significant challenge\
        \ for clustering algorithms. Identifying a putative optimum number of clusters\
        \ to group the objects into involves computing and evaluating a range of clusterings\
        \ with different numbers of clusters. However, there is no agreed or unique\
        \ definition of optimum in this context. Thus, we test PFClust on datasets\
        \ for which an external gold standard of 'correct' cluster definitions exists,\
        \ noting that this division into clusters may be suboptimal according to other\
        \ reasonable criteria. PFClust is heuristic in the sense that it cannot be\
        \ described in terms of optimising any single simply-expressed metric over\
        \ the space of possible clusterings.Results: We validate PFClust firstly with\
        \ reference to a number of synthetic datasets consisting of 2D vectors, showing\
        \ that its clustering performance is at least equal to that of six other leading\
        \ methodologies - even though five of the other methods are told in advance\
        \ how many clusters to use. We also demonstrate the ability of PFClust to\
        \ classify the three dimensional structures of protein domains, using a set\
        \ of folds taken from the structural bioinformatics database CATH.Conclusions:\
        \ We show that PFClust is able to cluster the test datasets a little better,\
        \ on average, than any of the other algorithms, and furthermore is able to\
        \ do this without the need to specify any external parameters. Results on\
        \ the synthetic datasets demonstrate that PFClust generates meaningful clusters,\
        \ while our algorithm also shows excellent agreement with the correct assignments\
        \ for a dataset extracted from the CATH part-manually curated classification\
        \ of protein domain structures. \xA9 2013 Mavridis et al.; licensee BioMed\
