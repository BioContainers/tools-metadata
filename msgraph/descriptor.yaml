    metadata:
      abstract: "The analysis of mixtures of unknowns using techniques interfacing\
        \ liquid chromatography (LC) with mass spectrometry (MS) often suffers from\
        \ the high abundance of background ions. To allow a quick search for components\
        \ in the mixtures, a special type of display has been developed that shows\
        \ all the data obtained in an analysis run simultaneously. On the screen,\
        \ the m/z information from the mass scan (in the x direction) and the time\
        \ (as scan number, in the y direction) are displayed with mass peaks given\
        \ as single points. The relative intensity of a signal is colour coded. Thus,\
        \ it is easy to recognize analyte signals as bright islands in a dark surrounding;\
        \ even weak signals in the vicinity of strong background ions are identified\
        \ quite clearly. Additionally, the program incorporates some features to allow\
        \ a simple operation and very fast investigation of the data. This article\
        \ is an electronic publication in Spectrochimica Acta Electronica (SAE), the\
        \ electronic section of Spectrochimica Acta Part B (SAB). The hardcopy text\
        \ is accompanied by a disk containing the program MSGRAPH, a manual, data\
        \ files and additional text files. \xA9 1993 Pergamon Press Ltd."
