      abstract: "\xA9 2015 VC The Author(s). Concept recognition tools rely on the\
        \ availability of textual corpora to assess their performance and enable the\
        \ identification of areas for improvement. Typically, corpora are developed\
        \ for specific purposes, such as gene name recognition. Gene and protein name\
        \ identification are longstanding goals of biomedical text mining, and therefore\
        \ a number of different corpora exist. However, phenotypes only recently became\
        \ an entity of interest for specialized concept recognition systems, and hardly\
        \ any annotated text is available for performance testing and training. Here,\
        \ we present a unique corpus, capturing text spans from 228 abstracts manually\
        \ annotated with Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts and harmonized by\
        \ three curators, which can be used as a reference standard for free text\
        \ annotation of human phenotypes. Furthermore, we developed a test suite for\
        \ standardized concept recognition error analysis, incorporating 32 different\
        \ types of test cases corresponding to 2164 HPO concepts. Finally, three established\
        \ phenotype concept recognizers (NCBO Annotator, OBO Annotator and Bio-LarK\
        \ CR) were comprehensively evaluated, and results are reported against both\
        \ the text corpus and the test suites. The gold standard and test suites corpora\
        \ are available from http://bio-lark.org/hpo-res.html."

      abstract: "\xA9 2015 The Authors. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is widely\
        \ used in the rare disease community for differential diagnostics, phenotype-driven\
        \ analysis of next-generation sequence-variation data, and translational research,\
        \ but a comparable resource has not been available for common disease. Here,\
        \ we have developed a concept-recognition procedure that analyzes the frequencies\
        \ of HPO disease annotations as identified in over five million PubMed abstracts\
        \ by employing an iterative procedure to optimize precision and recall of\
        \ the identified terms. We derived disease models for 3,145 common human diseases\
        \ comprising a total of 132,006 HPO annotations. The HPO now comprises over\
        \ 250,000 phenotypic annotations for over 10,000 rare and common diseases\
        \ and can be used for examining the phenotypic overlap among common diseases\
        \ that share risk alleles, as well as between Mendelian diseases and common\
        \ diseases linked by genomic location. The annotations, as well as the HPO\
        \ itself, are freely available."
