description: The IEMBASE accepts an array of biochemical and clinical symptoms from
  a user and returns a ranked list of possible IEM disorders that match the input
  profile. In addition, the system can explain the rationale of its results, suggest
  possible tests that would assist in narrowing down the differential diagnosis, and
  provide access to its database of biochemical, molecular, and clinical information
  if more evidence is desired.

      abstract: "\xA9 2018, The Author(s). Phenomics is the comprehensive study of\
        \ phenotypes at every level of biology: from metabolites to organisms. With\
        \ high throughput technologies increasing the scope of biological discoveries,\
        \ the field of phenomics has been developing rapid and precise methods to\
        \ collect, catalog, and analyze phenotypes. Such methods have allowed phenotypic\
        \ data to be widely used in medical applications, from assisting clinical\
        \ diagnoses to prioritizing genomic diagnoses. To channel the benefits of\
        \ phenomics into the field of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), we have recently\
        \ launched IEMbase, an expert-curated knowledgebase of IEM and their disease-characterizing\
        \ phenotypes. While our efforts with IEMbase have realized benefits, taking\
        \ full advantage of phenomics requires a comprehensive curation of IEM phenotypes\
        \ in core phenomics projects, which is dependent upon contributions from the\
        \ IEM clinical and research community. Here, we assess the inclusion of IEM\
        \ biochemical phenotypes in a core phenomics project, the Human Phenotype\
        \ Ontology. We then demonstrate the utility of biochemical phenotypes using\
        \ a text-based phenomics method to predict gene-disease relationships, showing\
        \ that the prediction of IEM genes is significantly better using biochemical\
        \ rather than clinical profiles. The findings herein provide a motivating\
        \ goal for the IEM community to expand the computationally accessible descriptions\
        \ of biochemical phenotypes associated with IEM in phenomics resources."
