description: ProteinART is a web tool that uses combinatorial optimization for protein
  inference from tandem mass spectrometry peptide identifications. It uses a set of
  confidently identified peptides, peptide detectability, and a protein database to
  provide the most likely set of identified proteins.

      abstract: "A major challenge in shotgun proteomics has been the assignment of\
        \ identified peptides to the proteins from which they originate, referred\
        \ to as the protein inference problem. Redundant and homologous protein sequences\
        \ present a challenge in being correctly identified, as a set of peptides\
        \ may in many cases represent multiple proteins. One simple solution to this\
        \ problem is the assignment of the smallest number of proteins that explains\
        \ the identified peptides. However, it is not certain that a natural system\
        \ should be accurately represented using this minimalist approach. In this\
        \ paper, we propose a reformulation of the protein inference problem by utilizing\
        \ the recently introduced concept of peptide detectability. We also propose\
        \ a heuristic algorithm to solve this problem and evaluate its performance\
        \ on synthetic and real proteomics data. In comparison to a greedy implementation\
        \ of the minimum protein set algorithm, our solution that incorporates peptide\
        \ detectability performs favorably. \xA9 2007 World Scientific Publishing\
