      abstract: "The accuracy and scalability of multiple sequence alignment (MSA)\
        \ of DNAs and proteins have long been and are still important issues in bioinformatics.\
        \ To rapidly construct a reasonable MSA, we developed the initial version\
        \ of the MAFFT program in 2002. MSA software is now facing greater challenges\
        \ in both scalability and accuracy than those of 5 years ago. As increasing\
        \ amounts of sequence data are being generated by large-scale sequencing projects,\
        \ scalability is now critical in many situations. The requirement of accuracy\
        \ has also entered a new stage since the discovery of functional noncoding\
        \ RNAs (ncRNAs); the secondary structure should be considered for constructing\
        \ a high-quality alignment of distantly related ncRNAs. To deal with these\
        \ problems, in 2007, we updated MAFFT to Version 6 with two new techniques:\
        \ the PartTree algorithm and the Four-way consistency objective function.\
        \ The former improved the scalability of progressive alignment and the latter\
        \ improved the accuracy of ncRNA alignment. We review these and other techniques\
        \ that MAFFT uses and suggest possible future directions of MSA software as\
        \ a basis of comparative analyses. MAFFT is available at http://align.bmr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mafft/software.\
