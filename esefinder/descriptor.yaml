    metadata:
      abstract: Point mutations frequently cause genetic diseases by disrupting the
        correct pattern of pre-mRNA splicing. The effect of a point mutation within
        a coding sequence is traditionally attributed to the deduced change in the
        corresponding amino acid. However, some point mutations can have much more
        severe effects on the structure of the encoded protein, for example when they
        inactivate an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), thereby resulting in exon skipping.
        ESEs also appear to be especially important in exons that normally undergo
        alternative splicing. Different classes of ESE consensus motifs have been
        described, but they are not always easily identified. ESEfinder (http://exon.cshl.edu/ESE/)
        is a web-based resource that facilitates rapid analysis of exon sequences
        to identify putative ESEs responsive to the human SR proteins SF2/ASF, SC35,
        SRp40 and SRp55, and to predict whether exonic mutations disrupt such elements.
