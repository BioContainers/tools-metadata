    metadata:
      abstract: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction has been an important
        research topic in bio-text mining area, since the PPI information is critical
        for understanding biological processes. However, there are very few open systems
        available on the Web and most of the systems focus on keyword searching based
        on predefined PPIs. PIE (Protein Interaction information Extraction system)
        is a configurable Web service to extract PPIs from literature, including user-provided
        papers as well as PubMed articles. After providing abstracts or papers, the
        prediction results are displayed in an easily readable form with essential,
        yet compact features. The PIE interface supports more features such as PDF
        file extraction, PubMed search tool and network communication, which are useful
        for biologists and bio-system developers. The PIE system utilizes natural
        language processing techniques and machine learning methodologies to predict
        PPI sentences, which results in high precision performance for Web users.
        PIE is freely available at http://bi.snu.ac.kr/pie/.
