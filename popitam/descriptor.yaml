      abstract: In recent years, proteomics research has gained importance due to
        increasingly powerful techniques in protein purification, mass spectrometry
        and identification, and due to the development of extensive protein and DNA
        databases from various organisms. Nevertheless, current identification methods
        from spectrometric data have difficulties in handling modifications or mutations
        in the source peptide. Moreover, they have low performance when run on large
        databases (such as genomic databases), or with low quality data, for example
        due to bad calibration or low fragmentation of the source peptide. We present
        a new algorithm dedicated to automated protein identification from tandem
        mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data by searching a peptide sequence database. Our
        identification approach shows promising properties for solving the specific
        difficulties enumerated above. It consists of matching theoretical peptide
        sequences issued from a database with a structured representation of the source
        MS/MS spectrum. The representation is similar to the spectrum graphs commonly
        used by de novo sequencing software. The identification process involves the
        parsing of the graph in order to emphazise relevant sections for each theoretical
        sequence, and leads to a list of peptides ranked by a correlation score. The
        parsing of the graph, which can be a highly combinatorial task, is performed
        by a bio-inspired algorithm called Ant Colony Optimization algorithm.
