description: AUGUSTUS is a eukaryotic gene prediction tool. It can integrate evidence,
  e.g. from RNA-Seq, ESTs, proteomics, but can also predict genes ab initio. The PPX
  extension to AUGUSTUS can take a protein sequence multiple sequence alignment as
  input to find new members of the family in a genome. It can be run through a web
  interface, or downloaded and run locally.

      abstract: "We present a www server for AUGUSTUS, a novel software program for\
        \ ab initio gene prediction in eukaryotic genomic sequences. Our method is\
        \ based on a generalized Hidden Markov Model with a new method for modeling\
        \ the intron length distribution. This method allows approximation of the\
        \ true intron length distribution more accurately than do existing programs.\
        \ For genomic sequence data from human and Drosophila melanogaster, the accuracy\
        \ of AUGUSTUS is superior to existing gene-finding approaches. The advantage\
        \ of our program becomes apparent especially for larger input sequences containing\
        \ more than one gene. The server is available at http://augustus.gobics.de.\

      abstract: "Background: In order to improve gene prediction, extrinsic evidence\
        \ on the gene structure can be collected from various sources of information\
        \ such as genome-genome comparisons and EST and protein alignments. However,\
        \ such evidence is often incomplete and usually uncertain. The extrinsic evidence\
        \ is usually not sufficient to recover the complete gene structure of all\
        \ genes completely and the available evidence is often unreliable. Therefore\
        \ extrinsic evidence is most valuable when it is balanced with sequence-intrinsic\
        \ evidence. Results: We present a fairly general method for integration of\
        \ external information. Our method is based on the evaluation of hints to\
        \ potentially protein-coding regions by means of a Generalized Hidden Morkov\
        \ Model (GHMM) that takes both intrinsic and extrinsic information into account.\
        \ We used this method to extend the ab initio gene prediction program AUGUSTUS\
        \ to a versatile tool that we call AUGUSTUS+. In this study, we focus on hints\
        \ derived from matches to an EST or protein database, but our approach can\
        \ be used to include arbitrary user-defined hints. Our method is only moderately\
        \ effected by the length of a database match. Further, it exploits the information\
        \ that can be derived from the absence of such matches. As a special case,\
        \ AUGUSTUS+ can predict genes under user-defined constraints, e.g. if the\
        \ positions of certain exons are known. With hints from EST and protein databases,\
        \ our new approach was able to predict 89% of the exons in human chromosome\
        \ 22 correctly. Conclusion: Sensitive probabilistic modeling of extrinsic\
        \ evidence such as sequence database matches can increase gene prediction\
        \ accuracy. When a match of a sequence interval to an EST or protein sequence\
        \ is used it should be treated as compound information rather than as information\
        \ about individual positions. \xA9 2006 Stanke et al; licensee BioMed Central\

      abstract: AUGUSTUS is a software tool for gene prediction in eukaryotes based
        on a Generalized Hidden Markov Model, a probabilistic model of a sequence
        and its gene structure. Like most existing gene finders, the first version
        of AUGUSTUS returned one transcript per predicted gene and ignored the phenomenon
        of alternative splicing. Herein, we present a WWW server for an extended version
        of AUGUSTUS that is able to predict multiple splice variants. To our knowledge,
        this is the first ab initio gene finder that can predict multiple transcripts.
        In addition, we offer a motif searching facility, where user-defined regular
        expressions can be searched against putative proteins encoded by the predicted
        genes. The AUGUSTUS web interface and the downloadable open-source stand-alone
        program are freely available from http://augustus.gobics.de.
