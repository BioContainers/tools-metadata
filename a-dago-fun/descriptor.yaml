description: Python library that provides a comprehensive and customized set of Gene
  Ontology (GO) based functional analysis tools that exploit the biological knowledge
  that GO offers in describing genes or groups of genes through the use of GO semantic
  similarity measures for biological knowledge discovery.

      abstract: "\xA9 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.Summary:\
        \ Gene Ontology (GO) semantic similarity measures are being used for biological\
        \ knowledge discovery based on GO annotations by integrating biological information\
        \ contained in the GO structure into data analyses. To empower users to quickly\
        \ compute, manipulate and explore these measures, we introduce A-DaGO-Fun\
        \ (ADaptable Gene Ontology semantic similarity-based Functional analysis).\
        \ It is a portable software package integrating all known GO information content-based\
        \ semantic similarity measures and relevant biological applications associated\
        \ with these measures. A-DaGO-Fun has the advantage not only of handling datasets\
        \ from the current high-throughput genome-wide applications, but also allowing\
        \ users to choose the most relevant semantic similarity approach for their\
        \ biological applications and to adapt a given module to their needs."
