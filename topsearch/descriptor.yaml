description: 'TopSearch is a new powerful gateway to protein structures and their
  structural relationships. Given a query structure the search engine instantly returns
  a list of known protein structures sorted by structural similarity. TopSearch operates
  on three structural levels: chains, biological assemblies and quaternary structures,
  and asymmetric units.'
