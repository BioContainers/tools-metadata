      abstract: "Background: The combination of mass spectrometry and solution phase\
        \ amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (H/D exchange) experiments is an effective\
        \ method for characterizing protein dynamics, and protein-protein or protein-ligand\
        \ interactions. Despite methodological advancements and improvements in instrumentation\
        \ and automation, data analysis and display remains a tedious process. The\
        \ factors that contribute to this bottleneck are the large number of data\
        \ points produced in a typical experiment, each requiring manual curation\
        \ and validation, and then calculation of the level of backbone amide exchange.\
        \ Tools have become available that address some of these issues, but lack\
        \ sufficient integration, functionality, and accessibility required to address\
        \ the needs of the H/D exchange community. To date there is no software for\
        \ the analysis of H/D exchange data that comprehensively addresses these issues.\
        \ Results: We have developed an integrated software system for the automated\
        \ analysis and representation of H/D exchange data that has been titled \"\
        The Deuterator\". Novel approaches have been implemented that enable high\
        \ throughput analysis, automated determination of deuterium incorporation,\
        \ and deconvolution of overlapping peptides. This has been achieved by using\
        \ methods involving iterative theoretical envelope fitting, and consideration\
        \ of peak data within expected m/z ranges. Existing common file formats have\
        \ been leveraged to allow compatibility with the output from the myriad of\
        \ MS instrument platforms and peptide sequence database search engines. A\
        \ web-based interface is used to integrate the components of The Deuterator\
        \ that are able to analyze and present mass spectral data from instruments\
        \ with varying resolving powers. The results, if necessary, can then be confirmed,\
        \ adjusted, re-calculated and saved. Additional tools synchronize the curated\
        \ calculation parameters with replicate time points, increasing throughput.\
        \ Saved results can then be used to plot deuterium buildup curves and 3D structural\
        \ overlays. The system has been used successfully in a production environment\
        \ for over one year and is freely available as a web tool at the project home\
        \ page http://deuterator.florida.scripps.edu. Conclusion: The automated calculation\
        \ and presentation of H/D exchange data in a user interface enables scientists\
        \ to organize and analyze data efficiently. Integration of the different components\
        \ of The Deuterator coupled with the flexibility of common data file formats\
        \ allow this system to be accessible to the broadening H/D exchange community.\
