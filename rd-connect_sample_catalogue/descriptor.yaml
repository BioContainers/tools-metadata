      abstract: "Background: There is a huge demand on bioinformaticians to provide\
        \ their biologists with user friendly and scalable software infrastructures\
        \ to capture, exchange, and exploit the unprecedented amounts of new *omics\
        \ data. We here present MOLGENIS, a generic, open source, software toolkit\
        \ to quickly produce the bespoke MOLecular GENetics Information Systems needed.Methods:\
        \ The MOLGENIS toolkit provides bioinformaticians with a simple language to\
        \ model biological data structures and user interfaces. At the push of a button,\
        \ MOLGENIS' generator suite automatically translates these models into a feature-rich,\
        \ ready-to-use web application including database, user interfaces, exchange\
        \ formats, and scriptable interfaces. Each generator is a template of SQL,\
        \ JAVA, R, or HTML code that would require much effort to write by hand. This\
        \ 'model-driven' method ensures reuse of best practices and improves quality\
        \ because the modeling language and generators are shared between all MOLGENIS\
        \ applications, so that errors are found quickly and improvements are shared\
        \ easily by a re-generation. A plug-in mechanism ensures that both the generator\
        \ suite and generated product can be customized just as much as hand-written\
        \ software.Results: In recent years we have successfully evaluated the MOLGENIS\
        \ toolkit for the rapid prototyping of many types of biomedical applications,\
        \ including next-generation sequencing, GWAS, QTL, proteomics and biobanking.\
        \ Writing 500 lines of model XML typically replaces 15,000 lines of hand-written\
        \ programming code, which allows for quick adaptation if the information system\
        \ is not yet to the biologist's satisfaction. Each application generated with\
        \ MOLGENIS comes with an optimized database back-end, user interfaces for\
        \ biologists to manage and exploit their data, programming interfaces for\
        \ bioinformaticians to script analysis tools in R, Java, SOAP, REST/JSON and\
        \ RDF, a tab-delimited file format to ease upload and exchange of data, and\
        \ detailed technical documentation. Existing databases can be quickly enhanced\
        \ with MOLGENIS generated interfaces using the 'ExtractModel' procedure.Conclusions:\
        \ The MOLGENIS toolkit provides bioinformaticians with a simple model to quickly\
        \ generate flexible web platforms for all possible genomic, molecular and\
        \ phenotypic experiments with a richness of interfaces not provided by other\
        \ tools. All the software and manuals are available free as LGPLv3 open source\
