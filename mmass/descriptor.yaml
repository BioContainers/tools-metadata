      abstract: "While tools for the automated analysis of MS and LC-MS/MS data are\
        \ continuously improving, it is still often the case that at the end of an\
        \ experiment, the mass spectrometrist will spend time carefully examining\
        \ individual spectra. Current software support is mostly provided only by\
        \ the instrument vendors, and the available software tools are often instrument-dependent.\
        \ Here we present a new generation of mMass, a cross-platform environment\
        \ for the precise analysis of individual mass spectra. The software covers\
        \ a wide range of processing tasks such as import from various data formats,\
        \ smoothing, baseline correction, peak picking, deisotoping, charge determination,\
        \ and recalibration. Functions presented in the earlier versions such as in\
        \ silico digestion and fragmentation were redesigned and improved. In addition\
        \ to Mascot, an interface for ProFound has been implemented. A specific tool\
        \ is available for isotopic pattern modeling to enable precise data validation.\
        \ The largest available lipid database (from the LIPID MAPS Consortium) has\
        \ been incorporated and together with the new compound search tool lipids\
        \ can be rapidly identified. In addition, the user can define custom libraries\
        \ of compounds and use them analogously. The new version of mMass is based\
        \ on a stand-alone Python library, which provides the basic functionality\
        \ for data processing and interpretation. This library can serve as a good\
        \ starting point for other developers in their projects. Binary distributions\
        \ of mMass, its source code, a detailed users guide, and video tutorials are\
        \ freely available from www.mmass.org. \xA9 2010 American Chemical Society."
