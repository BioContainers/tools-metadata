description: Delly2 is an integrated structural variant prediction method that can
  discover, genotype and visualize deletions, tandem duplications, inversions and
  translocations at single-nucleotide resolution in short-read massively parallel
  sequencing data. It uses paired-ends and split-reads to sensitively and accurately
  delineate genomic rearrangements throughout the genome. Structural variants can
  be visualized using Delly-maze and Delly-suave.

      abstract: "Motivation: The discovery of genomic structural variants (SVs) at\
        \ high sensitivity and specificity is an essential requirement for characterizing\
        \ naturally occurring variation and for understanding pathological somatic\
        \ rearrangements in personal genome sequencing data. Of particular interest\
        \ are integrated methods that accurately identify simple and complex rearrangements\
        \ in heterogeneous sequencing datasets at single-nucleotide resolution, as\
        \ an optimal basis for investigating the formation mechanisms and functional\
        \ consequences of SVs. Results: We have developed an SV discovery method,\
        \ called DELLY, that integrates short insert paired-ends, long-range matepairs\
        \ and split-read alignments to accurately delineate genomic rearrangements\
        \ at single-nucleotide resolution. DELLY is suitable for detecting copy-number\
        \ variable deletion and tandem duplication events as well as balanced rearrangements\
        \ such as inversions or reciprocal translocations. DELLY, thus, enables to\
        \ ascertain the full spectrum of genomic rearrangements, including complex\
        \ events. On simulated data, DELLY compares favorably to other SV prediction\
        \ methods across a wide range of sequencing parameters. On real data, DELLY\
        \ reliably uncovers SVs from the 1000 Genomes Project and cancer genomes,\
        \ and validation experiments of randomly selected deletion loci show a high\
        \ specificity. \xA9 The Author(s) 2012. Published by Oxford University Press."
