      abstract: "With the availability of the huge medical knowledge data on the Internet\
        \ such as the human disease network, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network,\
        \ and phenotypegene, gene-disease bipartite networks, it becomes practical\
        \ to help doctors by suggesting plausible hereditary diseases for a set of\
        \ clinical phenotypes. However, identifying candidate diseases that best explain\
        \ a set of clinical phenotypes by considering various heterogeneous networks\
        \ is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new method for\
        \ estimating a ranked list of plausible diseases by associating phenotypegene\
        \ with gene-disease bipartite networks. Our approach is to count the frequency\
        \ of all the paths from a phenotype to a disease through their associated\
        \ causative genes, and link the phenotype to the disease with path frequency\
        \ in a new phenotype-disease bipartite (PDB) network. After that, we generate\
        \ the candidate weights for the edges of phenotypes with diseases in PDB network.\
        \ We evaluate our proposed method in terms of Normalized Discounted Cumulative\
        \ Gain (NDCG), and demonstrate that we outperform the previously known disease\
        \ ranking method called Phenomizer. \xA9 2013 IEEE."
