      abstract: "The proposed model is based on the measurement of the retention times\
        \ of 346 tryptic peptides in the 560- to 4,000-Da mass range, derived from\
        \ a mixture of 17 protein digests. These peptides were measured in HPLC-MALDI\
        \ MS runs, with peptide identities confirmed by MS/MS. The model relies on\
        \ summation of the retention coefficients of the individual amino acids, as\
        \ in previous approaches, but additional terms are introduced that depend\
        \ on the retention coefficients for amino acids at the N-terminal of the peptide.\
        \ In the 17-protein mixture, optimization of two sets of coefficients, along\
        \ with additional compensation for peptide length and hydrophobicity, yielded\
        \ a linear dependence of retention time on hydrophobicity, with an R2 value\
        \ about 0.94. The predictive capability of the model was used to distinguish\
        \ peptides with close m/z values and for detailed peptide mapping of selected\
        \ proteins. Its applicability was tested on columns of different sizes, from\
        \ nano- to narrow-bore, and for direct sample injection, or injection via\
        \ a pre-column. It can be used for accurate prediction of retention times\
        \ for tryptic peptides on reversed-phase (300-\xC5 pore size) columns of different\
        \ sizes with a linear water-ACN gradient and with TFA as the ion-pairing modifier.\
