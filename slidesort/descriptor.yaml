      abstract: "Motivation: Recent progress in DNA sequencing technologies calls\
        \ for fast and accurate algorithms that can evaluate sequence similarity for\
        \ a huge amount of short reads. Searching similar pairs from a string pool\
        \ is a fundamental process of de novo genome assembly, genome-wide alignment\
        \ and other important analyses. Results: In this study, we designed and implemented\
        \ an exact algorithm SlideSort that finds all similar pairs from a string\
        \ pool in terms of edit distance. Using an efficient pattern growth algorithm,\
        \ SlideSort discovers chains of common k-mers to narrow down the search. Compared\
        \ to existing methods based on single k-mers, our method is more effective\
        \ in reducing the number of edit distance calculations. In comparison to backtracking\
        \ methods such as BWA, our method is much faster in finding remote matches,\
        \ scaling easily to tens of millions of sequences. Our software has an additional\
        \ function of single link clustering, which is useful in summarizing short\
        \ reads for further processing. \xA9 The Author(s) 2010. Published by Oxford\
