      abstract: "In this study, an attempt has been made to develop a method for predicting\
        \ weak hydrogen bonding interactions, namely, C\u03B1-H\u22EFO and C\u03B1\
        -H\u22EF\u03C0 interactions in proteins using artificial neural network. Both\
        \ standard feed-forward neural network (FNN) and recurrent neural networks\
        \ (RNN) have been trained and tested using five-fold cross-validation on a\
        \ non-homologous dataset of 2298 protein chains where no pair of sequences\
        \ has more than 25% sequence identity. It has been found that the prediction\
        \ accuracy varies with the separation distance between donor and acceptor\
        \ residues. The maximum sensitivity achieved with RNN for C\u03B1-H\u22EF\
        O is 51.2% when donor and acceptor residues are four residues apart (i.e.\
        \ at \u0394D-A=4) and for C\u03B1-H\u22EF\u03C0 is 82.1% at \u0394D-A=3. The\
        \ performance of RNN is increased by 1-3% for both types of interactions when\
        \ PSIPRED predicted protein secondary structure is used. Overall, RNN performs\
        \ better than feed-forward networks at all separation distances between donor-acceptor\
        \ pair for both types of interactions. Based on the observations, a web server\
        \ CHpredict (available at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/chpredict/) has\
        \ been developed for predicting donor and acceptor residues in C\u03B1-H\u22EF\
        O and C\u03B1-H\u22EF\u03C0 interactions in proteins. \xA9 2006 IOS Press.\
