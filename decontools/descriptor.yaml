      abstract: "Here a fully automated computer algorithm is applied to complex mass\
        \ spectra of peptides and proteins. This method uses a subtractive peak finding\
        \ routine to locate possible isotopic clusters in the spectrum, subjecting\
        \ these to a combination of the previous Fourier transform/Patterson method\
        \ for primary charge determination and the method for least-squares fitting\
        \ to a theoretically derived isotopic abundance distribution for m/z determination\
        \ of the most abundant isotopic peak, and the statistical reliability of this\
        \ determination. If a predicted protein sequence is available, each such m/z\
        \ value is checked for assignment as a sequence fragment. A new signal-to-noise\
        \ calculation procedure has been devised for accurate determination of baseline\
        \ and noise width for spectra with high peak density. In 2 h, the program\
        \ identified 824 isotopic clusters representing 581 mass values in the spectrum\
        \ of a GluC digest of a 191 kDa protein; this is >50% more than the number\
        \ of mass values found by the extremely tedious operator-applied methodology\
        \ used previously. The program should be generally applicable to classes of\
        \ large molecules, including DNA and polymers. Thorough high resolution analysis\
        \ of spectra by Horn (THRASH) is proposed as the program's verb. Copyright\
