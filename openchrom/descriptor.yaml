      abstract: "Background: Today, data evaluation has become a bottleneck in chromatographic\
        \ science. Analytical instruments equipped with automated samplers yield large\
        \ amounts of measurement data, which needs to be verified and analyzed. Since\
        \ nearly every GC/MS instrument vendor offers its own data format and software\
        \ tools, the consequences are problems with data exchange and a lack of comparability\
        \ between the analytical results. To challenge this situation a number of\
        \ either commercial or non-profit software applications have been developed.\
        \ These applications provide functionalities to import and analyze several\
        \ data formats but have shortcomings in terms of the transparency of the implemented\
        \ analytical algorithms and/or are restricted to a specific computer platform.Results:\
        \ This work describes a native approach to handle chromatographic data files.\
        \ The approach can be extended in its functionality such as facilities to\
        \ detect baselines, to detect, integrate and identify peaks and to compare\
        \ mass spectra, as well as the ability to internationalize the application.\
        \ Additionally, filters can be applied on the chromatographic data to enhance\
        \ its quality, for example to remove background and noise. Extended operations\
        \ like do, undo and redo are supported.Conclusions: OpenChrom is a software\
        \ application to edit and analyze mass spectrometric chromatographic data.\
        \ It is extensible in many different ways, depending on the demands of the\
        \ users or the analytical procedures and algorithms. It offers a customizable\
        \ graphical user interface. The software is independent of the operating system,\
        \ due to the fact that the Rich Client Platform is written in Java. OpenChrom\
        \ is released under the Eclipse Public License 1.0 (EPL). There are no license\
        \ constraints regarding extensions. They can be published using open source\
        \ as well as proprietary licenses. OpenChrom is available free of charge at\
        \ http://www.openchrom.net. \xA9 2010 Wenig and Odermatt; licensee BioMed\
