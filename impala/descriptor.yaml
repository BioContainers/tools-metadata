      abstract: "Pathway-level analysis is a powerful approach enabling interpretation\
        \ of post-genomic data at a higher level than that of individual biomolecules.\
        \ Yet, it is currently hard to integrate more than one type of omics data\
        \ in such an approach. Here, we present a web tool 'IMPaLA' for the joint\
        \ pathway analysis of transcriptomics or proteomics and metabolomics data.\
        \ It performs over-representation or enrichment analysis with user-specified\
        \ lists of metabolites and genes using over 3000 pre-annotated pathways from\
        \ 11 databases. As a result, pathways can be identified that may be disregulated\
        \ on the transcriptional level, the metabolic level or both. Evidence of pathway\
        \ disregulation is combined, allowing for the identification of additional\
        \ pathways with changed activity that would not be highlighted when analysis\
        \ is applied to any of the functional levels alone. The tool has been implemented\
        \ both as an interactive website and as a web service to allow a programming\
        \ interface. \xA9 The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All\
