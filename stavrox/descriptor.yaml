      abstract: "Chemical crosslinking in combination with mass spectrometry has matured\
        \ into an alternative approach to derive low-resolution structural information\
        \ of proteins and protein complexes. Yet, one of the major drawbacks of this\
        \ strategy remains the lack of software that is able to handle the large MS\
        \ datasets that are created after chemical crosslinking and enzymatic digestion\
        \ of the crosslinking reaction mixtures. Here, we describe a software, termed\
        \ StavroX, which has been specifically designed for analyzing highly complex\
        \ crosslinking datasets. The StavroX software was evaluated for three diverse\
        \ biological systems: (1) the complex between calmodulin and a peptide derived\
        \ from Munc13, (2) an N-terminal -laminin fragment, and (3) the complex between\
        \ guanylyl cyclase activating protein-2 and a peptide derived from retinal\
        \ guanylyl cyclase. We show that the StavroX software is advantageous for\
        \ analyzing crosslinked products due to its easy-to-use graphical user interface\
        \ and the highly automated analysis of mass spectrometry (MS) and tandem mass\
        \ spectrometry (MS/MS) data resulting in short times for analysis. StavroX\
        \ is expected to give a further push to the chemical crosslinking approach\
        \ as a routine technique for protein interaction studies. \xA9 2011 American\
        \ Society for Mass Spectrometry."
