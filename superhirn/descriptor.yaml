      abstract: "Label-free quantification of high mass resolution LC-MS data has\
        \ emerged as a promising technology for proteome analysis. Computational methods\
        \ are required for the accurate extraction of peptide signals from LC-MS data\
        \ and the tracking of these features across the measurements of different\
        \ samples. We present here an open source software tool, SuperHirn, that comprises\
        \ a set of modules to process LC-MS data acquired on a high resolution mass\
        \ spectrometer. The program includes newly developed functionalities to analyze\
        \ LC-MS data such as feature extraction and quantification, LC-MS similarity\
        \ analysis, LC-MS alignment of multiple datasets, and intensity normalization.\
        \ These program routines extract profiles of measured features and comprise\
        \ tools for clustering and classification analysis of the profiles. SuperHirn\
        \ was applied in an MS1-based profiling approach to a benchmark LC-MS dataset\
        \ of complex protein mixtures with defined concentration changes. We show\
        \ that the program automatically detects profiling trends in an unsupervised\
        \ manner and is able to associate proteins to their correct theoretical dilution\
        \ profile. \xA9 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA."
