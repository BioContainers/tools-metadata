      abstract: 'Summary: Pathway analysis of alternative splicing would be biased
        without accounting for the different number of exons or junctions associated
        with each gene, because genes with higher number of exons or junctions are
        more likely to be included in the ''significant'' gene list in alternative
        splicing. We present PathwaySplice, an R package that (i) Performs pathway
        analysis that explicitly adjusts for the number of exons or junctions associated
        with each gene; (ii) visualizes selection bias due to different number of
        exons or junctions for each gene and formally tests for presence of bias using
        logistic regression; (iii) supports gene sets based on the Gene Ontology terms,
        as well as more broadly defined gene sets (e.g. MSigDB) or user defined gene
        sets; (iv) identifies the significant genes driving pathway significance and
        (v) organizes significant pathways with an enrichment map, where pathways
        with large number of overlapping genes are grouped together in a network graph.
