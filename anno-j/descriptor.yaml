      abstract: "As our ability to generate sequencing data continues to increase,\
        \ data analysis is replacing data generation as the rate-limiting step in\
        \ genomics studies. Here we provide a guide to genomic data visualization\
        \ tools that facilitate analysis tasks by enabling researchers to explore,\
        \ interpret and manipulate their data, and in some cases perform on-the-fly\
        \ computations. We will discuss graphical methods designed for the analysis\
        \ of de novo sequencing assemblies and read alignments, genome browsing, and\
        \ comparative genomics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of these\
        \ approaches and the challenges ahead. \xA9 2010 Nature America, Inc. All\
