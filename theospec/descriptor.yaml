      abstract: "Summary: Scientists usually want to verify the ion matching process\
        \ of algorithms that look up peptide sequences in DNA or protein databases.\
        \ The verification step is often done numerically or visually. Not all search\
        \ algorithms present the appropriate theoretical spectrum information within\
        \ their results. Thus, the theoretical spectrum for each result should be\
        \ calculated from the sequence of the matched peptide. We present an operating-system-independent\
        \ command line tool for this purpose that can be integrated easily into complex\
        \ as well as existing environments, and can be used to present the theoretical\
        \ spectrum to the user in either graphical or tabular format by third party\
        \ products. \xA9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved."
