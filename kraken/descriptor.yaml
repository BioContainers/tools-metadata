description: System for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences, usually
  obtained through metagenomic studies. Previous attempts by other bioinformatics
  software to accomplish this task have often used sequence alignment or machine learning
  techniques that were quite slow, leading to the development of less sensitive but
  much faster abundance estimation programs. It aims to achieve high sensitivity and
  high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers and a novel classification algorithm.

      abstract: "Kraken is an ultrafast and highly accurate program for assigning\
        \ taxonomic labels to metagenomic DNA sequences. Previous programs designed\
        \ for this task have been relatively slow and computationally expensive, forcing\
        \ researchers to use faster abundance estimation programs, which only classify\
        \ small subsets of metagenomic data. Using exact alignment of k-mers, Kraken\
        \ achieves classification accuracy comparable to the fastest BLAST program.\
        \ In its fastest mode, Kraken classifies 100 base pair reads at a rate of\
        \ over 4.1 million reads per minute, 909 times faster than Megablast and 11\
        \ times faster than the abundance estimation program MetaPhlAn. Kraken is\
        \ available at http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/. \xA9 2014 Wood and Salzberg;\
