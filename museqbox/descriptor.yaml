description: Multi-query Sequence Blast Output Examination is a program designed for
  multi-query sequence BLAST output examination. It examines the BLAST output, extracts
  the informative parameters of BLAST hits, and saves them in tabular form in either
  text or HTML format. The hit tables are optionally further analyzed with the program
  to produce subsets of BLAST hits according to user-specified criteria.

      abstract: 'Summary: MuSeqBox is a program to parse BLAST output and store attributes
        of BLAST hits in tabular form. The user can apply a number of selection criteria
        to filter out hits with particular attributes. MuSeqBox provides a powerful
        annotation tool for large sets of query sequences that are simultaneously
        compared against a database with any of the standard stand-alone or network-client
        BLAST programs. We discuss such application to the problem of annotation and
        analysis of EST collections.'
