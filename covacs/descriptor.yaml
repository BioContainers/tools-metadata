description: A fully automated, highly accurate system with a web based graphical
  interface for genotyping and variant annotation. Extensive tests on a gold standard
  benchmark data-set -the NA12878 Illumina platinum genome- confirm that call-sets
  based on our consensus strategy are completely in line with those attained by similar
  command line based approaches, and far more accurate than call-sets from any individual
  tool.

    abstract: '© 2018 The Author(s). Background: The advent and ongoing development
      of next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) has led to a rapid increase
      in the rate of human genome re-sequencing data, paving the way for personalized
      genomics and precision medicine. The body of genome resequencing data is progressively
      increasing underlining the need for accurate and time-effective bioinformatics
      systems for genotyping - a crucial prerequisite for identification of candidate
      causal mutations in diagnostic screens. Results: Here we present CoVaCS, a fully
      automated, highly accurate system with a web based graphical interface for genotyping
      and variant annotation. Extensive tests on a gold standard benchmark data-set
      -the NA12878 Illumina platinum genome- confirm that call-sets based on our consensus
      strategy are completely in line with those attained by similar command line
      based approaches, and far more accurate than call-sets from any individual tool.
      Importantly our system exhibits better sensitivity and higher specificity than
      equivalent commercial software. Conclusions: CoVaCS offers optimized pipelines
      integrating state of the art tools for variant calling and annotation for whole
      genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES) and target-gene sequencing
      (TGS) data. The system is currently hosted at Cineca, and offers the speed of
      a HPC computing facility, a crucial consideration when large numbers of samples
      must be analysed. Importantly, all the analyses are performed automatically
      allowing high reproducibility of the results. As such, we believe that CoVaCS
      can be a valuable tool for the analysis of human genome resequencing studies.
      CoVaCS is available at: https://bioinformatics.cineca.it/covacs.'
