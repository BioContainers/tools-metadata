description: microTSS is a machine-learning algorithm that provides highly accurate,
  single-nucleotide resolution predictions for intergenic miRNA transcription start
  sites (TSSs). MicroTSS integrates high-resolution RNA-sequencing data with active
  transcription marks derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase-sequencing
  to enable the characterization of tissue-specific promoters

      abstract: "\xA9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.A large\
        \ fraction of microRNAs (miRNAs) are derived from intergenic non-coding loci\
        \ and the identification of their promoters remains 'elusive'. Here, we present\
        \ microTSS, a machine-learning algorithm that provides highly accurate, single-nucleotide\
        \ resolution predictions for intergenic miRNA transcription start sites (TSSs).\
        \ MicroTSS integrates high-resolution RNA-sequencing data with active transcription\
        \ marks derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase-sequencing to\
        \ enable the characterization of tissue-specific promoters. MicroTSS is validated\
        \ with a specifically designed Drosha-null/conditional-null mouse model, generated\
        \ using the conditional by inversion (COIN) methodology. Analyses of global\
        \ run-on sequencing data revealed numerous pri-miRNAs in human and mouse either\
        \ originating from divergent transcription at promoters of active genes or\
        \ partially overlapping with annotated long non-coding RNAs. MicroTSS is readily\
        \ applicable to any cell or tissue samples and constitutes the missing part\
        \ towards integrating the regulation of miRNA transcription into the modelling\
        \ of tissue-specific regulatory networks."
