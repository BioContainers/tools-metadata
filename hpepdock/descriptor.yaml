      abstract: "\xA9 The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on\
        \ behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. Protein-peptide interactions are crucial\
        \ in many cellular functions. Therefore, determining the structure of protein-peptide\
        \ complexes is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of related\
        \ biological processes and developing peptide drugs. HPEPDOCK is a novel web\
        \ server for blind protein-peptide docking through a hierarchical algorithm.\
        \ Instead of running lengthy simulations to refine peptide conformations,\
        \ HPEPDOCK considers the peptide flexibility through an ensemble of peptide\
        \ conformations generated by our MODPEP program. For blind global peptide\
        \ docking, HPEPDOCK obtained a success rate of 33.3% in binding mode prediction\
        \ on a benchmark of 57 unbound cases when the top 10 models were considered,\
        \ compared to 21.1% for pepATTRACT server. HPEPDOCK also performed well in\
        \ docking against homology models and obtained a success rate of 29.8% within\
        \ top 10 predictions. For local peptide docking, HPEPDOCK achieved a high\
        \ success rate of 72.6% on a benchmark of 62 unbound cases within top 10 predictions,\
        \ compared to 45.2% for HADDOCK peptide protocol. Our HPEPDOCK server is computationally\
        \ efficient and consumed an average of 29.8 mins for a global peptide docking\
        \ job and 14.2 mins for a local peptide docking job. The HPEPDOCK web server\
        \ is available at http://huanglab.phys.hust.edu.cn/hpepdock/."
