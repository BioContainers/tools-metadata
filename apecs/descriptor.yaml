      abstract: "LC-MALDI provides an often overlooked opportunity to exploit the\
        \ separation between LC-MS and MS/MS stages of a 2D-LC-MS-based proteomics\
        \ experiment, that is, by making a smarter selection for precursor fragmentation.\
        \ Apex Peptide Elution Chain Selection (APECS) is a simple and powerful method\
        \ for intensity-based peptide selection in a complex sample separated by 2D-LC,\
        \ using a MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument. It removes the peptide redundancy present\
        \ in the adjacent first-dimension (typically strong cation exchange, SCX)\
        \ fractions by constructing peptide elution profiles that link the precursor\
        \ ions of the same peptide across SCX fractions. Subsequently, the precursor\
        \ ion most likely to fragment successfully in a given profile is selected\
        \ for fragmentation analysis, selecting on precursor intensity and absence\
        \ of adjacent ions that may cofragment. To make the method independent of\
        \ experiment-specific tolerance criteria, we introduce the concept of the\
        \ branching factor, which measures the likelihood of false clustering of precursor\
        \ ions based on past experiments. By validation with a complex proteome sample\
        \ of Arabidopsis thaliana, APECS identified an equivalent number of peptides\
        \ as a conventional data-dependent acquisition method but with a 35% smaller\
        \ work load. Consequently, reduced sample depletion allowed further selection\
        \ of lower signal-to-noise ratio precursor ions, leading to a larger number\
        \ of identified unique peptides. \xA9 2010 American Chemical Society."
