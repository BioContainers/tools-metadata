description: 'Computational tool (Pasolli et al., 2016; doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004977)
  for metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of the strength
  of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. The tool (i) is based on machine
  learning classifiers, (ii) includes automatic model and feature selection steps,
  (iii) comprises cross-validation and cross-study analysis, and (iv) uses as features
  quantitative microbiome profiles including species-level relative abundances and
  presence of strain-specific markers.

  It provides also species-level taxonomic profiles, marker presence data, and metadata
  for 3000+ public available metagenomes.'

      abstract: "\xA9 2016 Pasolli et al. Shotgun metagenomic analysis of the human\
        \ associated microbiome provides a rich set of microbial features for prediction\
        \ and biomarker discovery in the context of human diseases and health conditions.\
        \ However, the use of such high-resolution microbial features presents new\
        \ challenges, and validated computational tools for learning tasks are lacking.\
        \ Moreover, classification rules have scarcely been validated in independent\
        \ studies, posing questions about the generality and generalization of disease-predictive\
        \ models across cohorts. In this paper, we comprehensively assess approaches\
        \ to metagenomics-based prediction tasks and for quantitative assessment of\
        \ the strength of potential microbiome-phenotype associations. We develop\
        \ a computational framework for prediction tasks using quantitative microbiome\
        \ profiles, including species-level relative abundances and presence of strain-specific\
        \ markers. A comprehensive meta-analysis, with particular emphasis on generalization\
        \ across cohorts, was performed in a collection of 2424 publicly available\
        \ metagenomic samples from eight large-scale studies. Cross-validation revealed\
        \ good disease-prediction capabilities, which were in general improved by\
        \ feature selection and use of strain-specific markers instead of species-level\
        \ taxonomic abundance. In cross-study analysis, models transferred between\
        \ studies were in some cases less accurate than models tested by within-study\
        \ cross-validation. Interestingly, the addition of healthy (control) samples\
        \ from other studies to training sets improved disease prediction capabilities.\
        \ Some microbial species (most notably Streptococcus anginosus) seem to characterize\
        \ general dysbiotic states of the microbiome rather than connections with\
        \ a specific disease. Our results in modelling features of the \u201Chealthy\u201D\
        \ microbiome can be considered a first step toward defining general microbial\
        \ dysbiosis. The software framework, microbiome profiles, and metadata for\
        \ thousands of samples are publicly available at http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaml."
