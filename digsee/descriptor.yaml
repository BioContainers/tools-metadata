    metadata:
      abstract: Biological events such as gene expression, regulation, phosphorylation,
        localization and protein catabolism play important roles in the development
        of diseases. Understanding the association between diseases and genes can
        be enhanced with the identification of involved biological events in this
        association. Although biological knowledge has been accumulated in several
        databases and can be accessed through the Web, there is no specialized Web
        tool yet allowing for a query into the relationship among diseases, genes
        and biological events. For this task, we developed DigSee to search MEDLINE
        abstracts for evidence sentences describing that 'genes' are involved in the
        development of 'cancer' through 'biological events'. DigSee is available through
        http://gcancer.org/digsee.
