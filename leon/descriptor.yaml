      abstract: "\xA9 2015 Benoit et al.Background: Data volumes generated by next-generation\
        \ sequencing (NGS) technologies is now a major concern for both data storage\
        \ and transmission. This triggered the need for more efficient methods than\
        \ general purpose compression tools, such as the widely used gzip method.\
        \ Results: We present a novel reference-free method meant to compress data\
        \ issued from high throughput sequencing technologies. Our approach, implemented\
        \ in the software Leon, employs techniques derived from existing assembly\
        \ principles. The method is based on a reference probabilistic de Bruijn Graph,\
        \ built de novo from the set of reads and stored in a Bloom filter. Each read\
        \ is encoded as a path in this graph, by memorizing an anchoring kmer and\
        \ a list of bifurcations. The same probabilistic de Bruijn Graph is used to\
        \ perform a lossy transformation of the quality scores, which allows to obtain\
        \ higher compression rates without losing pertinent information for downstream\
        \ analyses. Conclusions: Leon was run on various real sequencing datasets\
        \ (whole genome, exome, RNA-seq or metagenomics). In all cases, LEON showed\
        \ higher overall compression ratios than state-of-the-art compression software.\
        \ On a C. elegans whole genome sequencing dataset, LEON divided the original\
        \ file size by more than 20. Leon is an open source software, distributed\
        \ under GNU affero GPL License, available for download at http://gatb.inria.fr/software/leon/."
