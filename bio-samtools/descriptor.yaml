      abstract: "\xA9 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights\
        \ reserved. Motivation: bio-samtools is a Ruby language interface to SAMtools,\
        \ the highly popular library that provides utilities for manipulating high-throughput\
        \ sequence alignments in the Sequence Alignment/Map format. Advances in Ruby,\
        \ now allow us to improve the analysis capabilities and increase bio-samtools\
        \ utility, allowing users to accomplish a large amount of analysis using a\
        \ very small amount of code. bio-samtools can also be easily developed to\
        \ include additional SAMtools methods and hence stay current with the latest\
        \ SAMtools releases. Results: We have added new Ruby classes for the MPileup\
        \ and Variant Call Format (VCF) data formats emitted by SAMtools and introduced\
        \ more analysis methods for variant analysis, including alternative allele\
        \ calculation and allele frequency calling for SNPs. Our new implementation\
        \ of bio-samtools also ensures that all the functionality of the SAMtools\
        \ library is now supported and that bio-samtools can be easily extended to\
        \ include future changes in SAMtools. bio-samtools 2 also provides methods\
        \ that allow the user to directly produce visualization of alignment data."
