      abstract: "Background: The investigation of plant genome structure and evolution\
        \ requires comprehensive characterization of repetitive sequences that make\
        \ up the majority of higher plant nuclear DNA. Since genome-wide characterization\
        \ of repetitive elements is complicated by their high abundance and diversity,\
        \ novel approaches based on massively-parallel sequencing are being adapted\
        \ to facilitate the analysis. It has recently been demonstrated that the low-pass\
        \ genome sequencing provided by a single 454 sequencing reaction is sufficient\
        \ to capture information about all major repeat families, thus providing the\
        \ opportunity for efficient repeat investigation in a wide range of species.\
        \ However, the development of appropriate data mining tools is required in\
        \ order to fully utilize this sequencing data for repeat characterization.Results:\
        \ We adapted a graph-based approach for similarity-based partitioning of whole\
        \ genome 454 sequence reads in order to build clusters made of the reads derived\
        \ from individual repeat families. The information about cluster sizes was\
        \ utilized for assessing the proportion and composition of repeats in the\
        \ genomes of two model species, Pisum sativum and Glycine max, differing in\
        \ genome size and 454 sequencing coverage. Moreover, statistical analysis\
        \ and visual inspection of the topology of the cluster graphs using a newly\
        \ developed program tool, SeqGrapheR, were shown to be helpful in distinguishing\
        \ basic types of repeats and investigating sequence variability within repeat\
        \ families.Conclusions: Repetitive regions of plant genomes can be efficiently\
        \ characterized by the presented graph-based analysis and the graph representation\
        \ of repeats can be further used to assess the variability and evolutionary\
        \ divergence of repeat families, discover and characterize novel elements,\
        \ and aid in subsequent assembly of their consensus sequences. \xA9 2010 Nov\xE1\
