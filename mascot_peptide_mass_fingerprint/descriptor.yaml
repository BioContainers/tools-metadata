      abstract: "Peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-MS and sequencing by tandem\
        \ mass spectrometry have evolved into the major methods for identification\
        \ of proteins following separation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis,\
        \ SDS-PAGE or liquid chromatography. One main technological goal of proteome\
        \ analyses beside high sensitivity and automation was the comprehensive analysis\
        \ of proteins. Therefore, the protein species level with the essential information\
        \ on co- and post-translational modifications must be achieved. The power\
        \ of peptide mass fingerprinting for protein identification was described\
        \ here, as exemplified by the identification of protein species with high\
        \ molecular masses (spectrin \u03B1 and \u03B2), low molecular masses (elongation\
        \ factor EF-TU fragments), splice variants (\u03B1 A crystallin), aggregates\
        \ with disulfide bridges (alkylhydroperoxide reductase), and phosphorylated\
        \ proteins (heat shock protein 27). Helpful tools for these analyses were\
        \ the use of the minimal protein identifier concept and the software program\
        \ MS-Screener to remove mass peaks assignable to contaminants and neighbor\
        \ spots. \xA9 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
