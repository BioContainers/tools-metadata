      abstract: "\xA9 2015 Elsevier B.V. Chemical cross-linking has emerged as a powerful\
        \ approach for the structural characterization of proteins and protein complexes.\
        \ However, the correct identification of covalently linked (cross-linked or\
        \ XL) peptides analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry is still an open challenge.\
        \ Here we present SIM-XL, a software tool that can analyze data generated\
        \ through commonly used cross-linkers (e.g., BS3/DSS). Our software introduces\
        \ a new paradigm for search-space reduction, which ultimately accounts for\
        \ its increase in speed and sensitivity. Moreover, our search engine is the\
        \ first to capitalize on reporter ions for selecting tandem mass spectra derived\
        \ from cross-linked peptides. It also makes available a 2D interaction map\
        \ and a spectrum-annotation tool unmatched by any of its kind. We show SIM-XL\
        \ to be more sensitive and faster than a competing tool when analyzing a data\
        \ set obtained from the human HSP90. The software is freely available for\
        \ academic use at http://patternlabforproteomics.org/sim-xl. A video demonstrating\
        \ the tool is available at http://patternlabforproteomics.org/sim-xl/video.\
        \ SIM-XL is the first tool to support XL data in the mzIdentML format; all\
        \ data are thus available from the ProteomeXchange consortium (identifier\
        \ PXD001677).This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Computational\
        \ Proteomics."
