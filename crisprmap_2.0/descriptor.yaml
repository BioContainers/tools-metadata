description: CRISPRmap provides a quick and detailed insight into repeat conservation
  and diversity of both bacterial and archaeal systems. It comprises the largest dataset
  of CRISPRs to date and enables comprehensive independent clustering analyses to
  determine conserved sequence families, potential structure motifs for endoribonucleases,
  and evolutionary relationships.

    abstract: 'Central to Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat
      (CRISPR)-Cas systems are repeated RNA sequences that serve as Cas-protein-binding
      templates. Classification is based on the architectural composition of associated
      Cas proteins, considering repeat evolution is essential to complete the picture.
      We compiled the largest data set of CRISPRs to date, performed comprehensive,
      independent clustering analyses and identified a novel set of 40 conserved sequence
      families and 33 potential structure motifs for Cas-endoribonucleases with some
      distinct conservation patterns. Evolutionary relationships are presented as
      a hierarchical map of sequence and structure similarities for both a quick and
      detailed insight into the diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems. In a comparison with
      Cas-subtypes, I-C, I-E, I-F and type II were strongly coupled and the remaining
      type I and type III subtypes were loosely coupled to repeat and Cas1 evolution,
      respectively. Subtypes with a strong link to CRISPR evolution were almost exclusive
      to bacteria; nevertheless, we identified rare examples of potential horizontal
      transfer of I-C and I-E systems into archaeal organisms. Our easy-to-use web
      server provides an automated assignment of newly sequenced CRISPRs to our classification
      system and enables more informed choices on future hypotheses in CRISPR-Cas
