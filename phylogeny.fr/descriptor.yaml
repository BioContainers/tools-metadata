      abstract: 'Phylogenetic analyses are central to many research areas in biology
        and typically involve the identification of homologous sequences, their multiple
        alignment, the phylogenetic reconstruction and the graphical representation
        of the inferred tree. The Phylogeny.fr platform transparently chains programs
        to automatically perform these tasks. It is primarily designed for biologists
        with no experience in phylogeny, but can also meet the needs of specialists;
        the first ones will find up-to-date tools chained in a phylogeny pipeline
        to analyze their data in a simple and robust way, while the specialists will
        be able to easily build and run sophisticated analyses. Phylogeny.fr offers
        three main modes. The ''One Click'' mode targets non-specialists and provides
        a ready-to-use pipeline chaining programs with recognized accuracy and speed:
        MUSCLE for multiple alignment, PhyML for tree building, and TreeDyn for tree
        rendering. All parameters are set up to suit most studies, and users only
        have to provide their input sequences to obtain a ready-to-print tree. The
        ''Advanced'' mode uses the same pipeline but allows the parameters of each
        program to be customized by users. The ''A la Carte'' mode offers more flexibility
        and sophistication, as users can build their own pipeline by selecting and
        setting up the required steps from a large choice of tools to suit their specific
        needs. Prior to phylogenetic analysis, users can also collect neighbors of
        a query sequence by running BLAST on general or specialized databases. A guide
        tree then helps to select neighbor sequences to be used as input for the phylogeny
        pipeline. Phylogeny.fr is available at: http://www.phylogeny.fr/'

      abstract: "Background. The right sampling of homologous sequences for phylogenetic\
        \ or molecular evolution analyses is a crucial step, the quality of which\
        \ can have a significant impact on the final interpretation of the study.\
        \ There is no single way for constructing datasets suitable for phylogenetic\
        \ analysis, because this task intimately depends on the scientific question\
        \ we want to address, Moreover, database mining softwares such as BLAST which\
        \ are routinely used for searching homologous sequences are not specifically\
        \ optimized for this task. Results. To fill this gap, we designed BLAST-Explorer,\
        \ an original and friendly web-based application that combines a BLAST search\
        \ with a suite of tools that allows interactive, phylogenetic-oriented exploration\
        \ of the BLAST results and flexible selection of homologous sequences among\
        \ the BLAST hits. Once the selection of the BLAST hits is done using BLAST-Explorer,\
        \ the corresponding sequence can be imported locally for external analysis\
        \ or passed to the phylogenetic tree reconstruction pipelines available on\
        \ the Phylogeny.fr platform. Conclusions. BLAST-Explorer provides a simple,\
        \ intuitive and interactive graphical representation of the BLAST results\
        \ and allows selection and retrieving of the BLAST hit sequences based a wide\
        \ range of criterions. Although BLAST-Explorer primarily aims at helping the\
        \ construction of sequence datasets for further phylogenetic study, it can\
        \ also be used as a standard BLAST server with enriched output. BLAST-Explorer\
        \ is available at http://www.phylogeny.fr. \xA9 2010 Dereeper et al; licensee\
