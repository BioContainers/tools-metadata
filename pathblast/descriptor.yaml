      abstract: "PathBLAST is a network alignment and search tool for comparing protein\
        \ interaction networks across species to identify protein pathways and complexes\
        \ that have been conserved by evolution. The basic method searches for high-scoring\
        \ alignments between pairs of protein interaction paths, for which proteins\
        \ of the first path are paired with putative orthologs occurring in the same\
        \ order in the second path. This technique discriminates between true- and\
        \ false-positive interactions and allows for functional annotation of protein\
        \ interaction pathways based on similarity to the network of another, well-characterized\
        \ species. PathBLAST is now available at http://www.path blast.org/ as a web-based\
        \ query. In this implementation, the user specifies a short protein interaction\
        \ path for query against a target protein-protein interaction network selected\
        \ from a network database. PathBLAST returns a ranked list of matching paths\
        \ from the target network along with a graphical view of these paths and the\
        \ overlap among them. Target protein-protein interaction networks are currently\
        \ available for Helicobacter pylori, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis\
        \ elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Just as BLAST enables rapid comparison\
        \ of protein sequences between genomes, tools such as PathBLAST are enabling\
        \ comparative genomics at the network level. \xA9 Oxford University Press\
