      abstract: "The Bayesian regularization method for high-throughput differential\
        \ analysis, described in Baldi and Long (A Bayesian framework for the analysis\
        \ of microarray expression data: regularized t-test and statistical inferences\
        \ of gene changes. Bioinformatics 2001: 17: 509-519) and implemented in the\
        \ Cyber-T web server, is one of the most widely validated. Cyber-T implements\
        \ a t-test using a Bayesian framework to compute a regularized variance of\
        \ the measurements associated with each probe under each condition. This regularized\
        \ estimate is derived by flexibly combining the empirical measurements with\
        \ a prior, or background, derived from pooling measurements associated with\
        \ probes in the same neighborhood. This approach flexibly addresses problems\
        \ associated with low replication levels and technology biases, not only for\
        \ DNA microarrays, but also for other technologies, such as protein arrays,\
        \ quantitative mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq).\
        \ Here we present an update to the Cyber-T web server, incorporating several\
        \ useful new additions and improvements. Several preprocessing data normalization\
        \ options including logarithmic and (Variance Stabilizing Normalization) VSN\
        \ transforms are included. To augment two-sample t-tests, a one-way analysis\
        \ of variance is implemented. Several methods for multiple tests correction,\
        \ including standard frequentist methods and a probabilistic mixture model\
        \ treatment, are available. Diagnostic plots allow visual assessment of the\
        \ results. The web server provides comprehensive documentation and example\
        \ data sets. The Cyber-T web server, with R source code and data sets, is\
        \ publicly available at http://cybert.ics.uci.edu/. \xA9 2012 The Author(s)."
