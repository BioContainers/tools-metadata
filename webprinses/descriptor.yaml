description: A tool encompasses two separate software applications. The first is WebPrInSeS-C
  which performs automated sequence verification of user-defined open-reading frame
  (ORF) clone libraries. The second is WebPrInSeS-E, which identifies positive hits
  in cDNA or ORF-based library screening experiments such as yeast one- or two-hybrid
  assays.

    abstract: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is revolutionizing our ability to obtain
      cheap, fast and reliable sequence information. Many experimental approaches
      are expected to benefit from the incorporation of such sequencing features in
      their pipeline. Consequently, software tools that facilitate such an incorporation
      should be of great interest. In this context, we developed WebPrInSeS, a web
      server tool allowing automated full-length clone sequence identification and
      verification using HTS data. WebPrInSeS encompasses two separate software applications.
      The first is WebPrInSeS-C which performs automated sequence verification of
      user-defined open-reading frame (ORF) clone libraries. The second is WebPrInSeS-E,
      which identifies positive hits in cDNA or ORF-based library screening experiments
      such as yeast oneor two-hybrid assays. Both tools perform de novo assembly using
      HTS data from any of the three major sequencing platforms. Thus, WebPrInSeS
      provides a highly integrated, cost-effective and efficient way to sequence-verify
      or identify clones of interest. WebPrInSeS is available at http://webprinses.epfl.ch/
      and is open to all users. Â© The Author(s) 2010. Published by Oxford University
