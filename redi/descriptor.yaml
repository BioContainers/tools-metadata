      abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems are mathematical models that describe how
        the concentrations of substances distributed in space change under the influence
        of local chemical reactions, and diffusion which causes the substances to
        spread out in space. The classical representation of a reaction-diffusion
        system is given by semi-linear parabolic partial differential equations, whose
        solution predicts how diffusion causes the concentration field to change with
        time. This change is proportional to the diffusion coefficient. If the solute
        moves in a homogeneous system in thermal equilibrium, the diffusion coefficients
        are constants that do not depend on the local concentration of solvent and
        solute. However, in nonhomogeneous and structured media the assumption of
        constant intracellular diffusion coefficient is not necessarily valid, and,
        consequently, the diffusion coefficient is a function of the local concentration
        of solvent and solutes. In this paper we propose a stochastic model of reaction-diffusion
        systems, in which the diffusion coefficients are function of the local concentration,
        viscosity and frictional forces. We then describe the software tool Redi (REaction-DIffusion
        simulator) which we have developed in order to implement this model into a
        Gillespie-like stochastic simulation algorithm. Finally, we show the ability
        of our model implemented in the Redi tool to reproduce the observed gradient
        of the bicoid protein in the Drosophila Melanogaster embryo. With Redi, we
        were able to simulate with an accuracy of 1% the experimental spatio-temporal
        dynamics of the bicoid protein, as recorded in time-lapse experiments obtained
        by direct measurements of transgenic bicoidenhanced green fluorescent protein.
