      abstract: "Filtration techniques in the form of rapid elimination of candidate\
        \ sequences while retaining the true one are key ingredients of database searches\
        \ in genomics. Although SEQUEST and Mascot perform a conceptually similar\
        \ task to the tool BLAST, the key algorithmic idea of BLAST (filtration) was\
        \ never implemented in these tools. As a result MS/MS protein identification\
        \ tools are becoming too time-consuming for many applications including search\
        \ for post-translationally modified peptides. Moreover, matching millions\
        \ of spectra against all known proteins will soon make these tools too slow\
        \ in the same way that \"genome vs genome\" comparisons instantly made BLAST\
        \ too slow. We describe the development of filters for MS/MS database searches\
        \ that dramatically reduce the running time and effectively remove the bottlenecks\
        \ in searching the huge space of protein modifications. Our approach, based\
        \ on a probability model for determining the accuracy of sequence tags, achieves\
        \ superior results compared to GutenTag, a popular tag generation algorithm.\
        \ Our tag generating algorithm along with our de novo sequencing algorithm\
        \ PepNovo can be accessed via the URL http://peptide.ucsd.edu/. \xA9 2005\
