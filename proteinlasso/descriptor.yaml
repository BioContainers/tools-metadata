      abstract: "Protein inference is an important issue in proteomics research. Its\
        \ main objective is to select a proper subset of candidate proteins that best\
        \ explain the observed peptides. Although many methods have been proposed\
        \ for solving this problem, several issues such as peptide degeneracy and\
        \ one-hit wonders still remain unsolved. Therefore, the accurate identification\
        \ of proteins that are truly present in the sample continues to be a challenging\
        \ task. Based on the concept of peptide detectability, we formulate the protein\
        \ inference problem as a constrained Lasso regression problem, which can be\
        \ solved very efficiently through a coordinate descent procedure. The new\
        \ inference algorithm is named as ProteinLasso, which explores an ensemble\
        \ learning strategy to address the sparsity parameter selection problem in\
        \ Lasso model. We test the performance of ProteinLasso on three datasets.\
        \ As shown in the experimental results, ProteinLasso outperforms those state-of-the-art\
        \ protein inference algorithms in terms of both identification accuracy and\
        \ running efficiency. In addition, we show that ProteinLasso is stable under\
        \ different parameter specifications. The source code of our algorithm is\
        \ available at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ proteinlasso. \xA9 2013 Elsevier\
        \ Ltd. All rights reserved."
