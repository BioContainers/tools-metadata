      abstract: "\xA9 The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation:\
        \ Sequence databases are growing fast, challenging existing analysis pipelines.\
        \ Reducing the redundancy of sequence databases by similarity clustering improves\
        \ speed and sensitivity of iterative searches. But existing tools cannot efficiently\
        \ cluster databases of the size of UniProt to 50% maximum pairwise sequence\
        \ identity or below. Furthermore, in metagenomics experiments typically large\
        \ fractions of reads cannot be matched to any known sequence anymore because\
        \ searching with sensitive but relatively slow tools (e.g. BLAST or HMMER3)\
        \ through comprehensive databases such as UniProt is becoming too costly.\
        \ Results: MMseqs (Many-against-Many sequence searching) is a software suite\
        \ for fast and deep clustering and searching of large datasets, such as UniProt,\
        \ or 6-frame translated metagenomics sequencing reads. MMseqs contains three\
        \ core modules: a fast and sensitive prefiltering module that sums up the\
        \ scores of similar k-mers between query and target sequences, an SSE2- and\
        \ multi-core-parallelized local alignment module, and a clustering module.\
        \ In our homology detection benchmarks, MMseqs is much more sensitive and\
        \ 4-30 times faster than UBLAST and RAPsearch, respectively, although it does\
        \ not reach BLAST sensitivity yet. Using its cascaded clustering workflow,\
        \ MMseqs can cluster large databases down to \u223C30% sequence identity at\
        \ hundreds of times the speed of BLASTclust and much deeper than CD-HIT and\
        \ USEARCH. MMseqs can also update a database clustering in linear instead\
        \ of quadratic time. Its much improved sensitivity-speed trade-off should\
        \ make MMseqs attractive for a wide range of large-scale sequence analysis\
        \ tasks."
