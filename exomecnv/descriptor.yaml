      abstract: "Motivation: The ability to detect copy-number variation (CNV) and\
        \ loss of heterozygosity (LOH) from exome sequencing data extends the utility\
        \ of this powerful approach that has mainly been used for point or small insertion/deletion\
        \ detection.Results: We present ExomeCNV, a statistical method to detect CNV\
        \ and LOH using depth-of-coverage and B-allele frequencies, from mapped short\
        \ sequence reads, and we assess both the method's power and the effects of\
        \ confounding variables. We apply our method to a cancer exome resequencing\
        \ dataset. As expected, accuracy and resolution are dependent on depth-of-coverage\
        \ and capture probe design. \xA9 The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University\
