      abstract: "Summary: The classification of transposable elements (TEs) is key\
        \ step towards deciphering their potential impact on the genome. However,\
        \ this process is often based on manual sequence inspection by TE experts.\
        \ With the wealth of genomic sequences now available, this task requires automation,\
        \ making it accessible to most scientists. We propose a new tool, PASTEC,\
        \ which classifies TEs by searching for structural features and similarities.\
        \ This tool outperforms currently available software for TE classification.\
        \ The main innovation of PASTEC is the search for HMM profiles, which is useful\
        \ for inferring the classification of unknown TE on the basis of conserved\
        \ functional domains of the proteins. In addition, PASTEC is the only tool\
        \ providing an exhaustive spectrum of possible classifications to the order\
        \ level of the Wicker hierarchical TE classification system. It can also automatically\
        \ classify other repeated elements, such as SSR (Simple Sequence Repeats),\
        \ rDNA or potential repeated host genes. Finally, the output of this new tool\
        \ is designed to facilitate manual curation by providing to biologists with\
        \ all the evidence accumulated for each TE consensus. Availability: PASTEC\
        \ is available as a REPET module or standalone software (http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/download/repet/REPET-linux-x64-2.2.tar.\
        \ gz). It requires a Unix-like system. There are two standalone versions:\
        \ one of which is parallelized (requiring Sun grid Engine or Torque), and\
        \ the other of which is not. \xA9 2014 Hoede et al."
