      abstract: The CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4) software
        suite is a collection of programs and associated data and software libraries
        which can be used for macromolecular structure determination by X-ray crystallography.
        The suite is designed to be flexible, allowing users a number of methods of
        achieving their aims. The programs are from a wide variety of sources but
        are connected by a common infrastructure provided by standard file formats,
        data objects and graphical interfaces. Structure solution by macromolecular
        crystallography is becoming increasingly automated and the CCP4 suite includes
        several automation pipelines. After giving a brief description of the evolution
        of CCP4 over the last 30 years, an overview of the current suite is given.
        While detailed descriptions are given in the accompanying articles, here it
        is shown how the individual programs contribute to a complete software package.
