      abstract: "\xA9 The Author(s) 2015. New technologies are revolutionising biological\
        \ research and its applications by making it easier and cheaper to generate\
        \ ever-greater volumes and types of data. In response, the services and infrastructure\
        \ of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI, www.ebi.ac.UK) are continually\
        \ expanding: total disk capacity increases significantly every year to keep\
        \ pace with demand (75 petabytes as of December 2015), and interoperability\
        \ between resources remains a strategic priority. Since 2014 we have launched\
        \ two new resources: the European Variation Archive for genetic variation\
        \ data and EMPIAR for two-dimensional electron microscopy data, as well as\
        \ a Resource Description Framework platform. We also launched the Embassy\
        \ Cloud service, which allows users to run large analyses in a virtual environment\
        \ next to EMBL-EBI's vast public data resources."
