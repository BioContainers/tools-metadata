description: It is a public database for genome-wide collections of gene phylogenies
  (phylomes). It is also a major source for phylogeny-based orthology and paralogy
  predictions. For each protein-coding gene in a seed genome, the database provides
  original and processed alignments, phylogenetic trees derived from various methods
  and phylogeny-based predictions of orthology and paralogy relationships.

    abstract: The growing availability of complete genomic sequences from diverse
      species has brought about the need to scale up phylogenomic analyses, including
      the reconstruction of large collections of phylogenetic trees. Here, we present
      the third version of PhylomeDB (http://phylomeDB.org), a public database for
      genome-wide collections of gene phylogenies (phylomes). Currently, PhylomeDB
      is the largest phylogenetic repository and hosts 17 phylomes, comprising 416
      093 trees and 165 840 alignments. It is also a major source for phylogeny-based
      orthology and paralogy predictions, covering about 5 million proteins in 717
      fully-sequenced genomes. For each protein-coding gene in a seed genome, the
      database provides original and processed alignments, phylogenetic trees derived
      from various methods and phylogeny-based predictions of orthology and paralogy
      relationships. The new version of phylomeDB has been extended with novel data
      access and visualization features, including the possibility of programmatic
      access. Available seed species include model organisms such as human, yeast,
      Escherichia coli or Arabidopsis thaliana, but also alternative model species
      such as the human pathogen Candida albicans, or the pea aphid Acyrtosiphon pisum.
      Finally, PhylomeDB is currently being used by several genome sequencing projects
      that couple the genome annotation process with the reconstruction of the corresponding
      phylome, a strategy that provides relevant evolutionary insights. Â© The Author(s)
