      abstract: "\xA9 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights\
        \ reserved.Motivation: Unambiguous sequence variant descriptions are important\
        \ in reporting the outcome of clinical diagnostic DNA tests. The standard\
        \ nomenclature of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) describes the\
        \ observed variant sequence relative to a given reference sequence. We propose\
        \ an efficient algorithm for the extraction of HGVS descriptions from two\
        \ sequences with three main requirements in mind: minimizing the length of\
        \ the resulting descriptions, minimizing the computation time and keeping\
        \ the unambiguous descriptions biologically meaningful. Results: Our algorithm\
        \ is able to compute the HGVS descriptions of complete chromosomes or other\
        \ large DNA strings in a reasonable amount of computation time and its resulting\
        \ descriptions are relatively small. Additional applications include updating\
        \ of gene variant database contents and reference sequence liftovers."
