      abstract: "\xA9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. There are few better examples of\
        \ the need for data sharing than in the rare disease community, where patients,\
        \ physicians, and researchers must search for \"the needle in a haystack\"\
        \ to uncover rare, novel causes of disease within the genome. Impeding the\
        \ pace of discovery has been the existence of many small siloed datasets within\
        \ individual research or clinical laboratory databases and/or disease-specific\
        \ organizations, hoping for serendipitous occasions when two distant investigators\
        \ happen to learn they have a rare phenotype in common and can \"match\" these\
        \ cases to build evidence for causality. However, serendipity has never proven\
        \ to be a reliable or scalable approach in science. As such, the Matchmaker\
        \ Exchange (MME) was launched to provide a robust and systematic approach\
        \ to rare disease gene discovery through the creation of a federated network\
        \ connecting databases of genotypes and rare phenotypes using a common application\
        \ programming interface (API). The core building blocks of the MME have been\
        \ defined and assembled. Three MME services have now been connected through\
        \ the API and are available for community use. Additional databases that support\
        \ internal matching are anticipated to join the MME network as it continues\
        \ to grow."
