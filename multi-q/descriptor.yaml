      abstract: "The iTRAQ labeling method combined with shotgun proteomic techniques\
        \ represents a new dimension in multiplexed quantitation for relative protein\
        \ expression measurement in different cell states. To expedite the analysis\
        \ of vast amounts of spectral data, we present a fully automated software\
        \ package, called Multi-Q, for multiplexed iTRAQ-based quantitation in protein\
        \ profiling. Multi-Q is designed as a generic platform that can accommodate\
        \ various input data formats from search engines and mass spectrometer manufacturers.\
        \ To calculate peptide ratios, the software automatically processes iTRAQ's\
        \ signature peaks, including peak detection, background subtraction, isotope\
        \ correction, and normalization to remove systematic errors. Furthermore,\
        \ Multi-Q allows users to define their own data-filtering thresholds based\
        \ on semiempirical values or statistical models so that the computed results\
        \ of fold changes in peptide ratios are statistically significant. This feature\
        \ facilitates the use of Multi-Q with various instrument types with different\
        \ dynamic ranges, which is an important aspect of iTRAQ analysis. The performance\
        \ of Multi-Q is evaluated with a mixture of 10 standard proteins and human\
        \ Jurkat T cells. The results are consistent with expected protein ratios\
        \ and thus demonstrate the high accuracy, full automation, and high-throughput\
        \ capability of Multi-Q as a large-scale quantitation proteomics tool. These\
        \ features allow rapid interpretation of output from large proteomic datasets\
        \ without the need for manual validation. Executable Multi-Q files are available\
        \ on Windows platform at http://ms.iis.sinica.edu.tw/Multi-Q/. \xA9 2006 American\
